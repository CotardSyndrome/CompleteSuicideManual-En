<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>This book describes in detail how to commit suicide.</p>
<p>This book is not a chronicle of suiciders, nor is it an attempt to
explain the reasons for suicide. Although it can be read as a book of
miscellaneous notes, the entire book is in the direction of “how to
commit suicide”.</p>
<p>Maybe you are tired of the long-winded opening remarks.</p>
<p>I don’t know since when, the topic of “Why do young people want to
die?” has been discussed over and over again. For example, in the 1970s,
the conclusions reached were “Triple-nihilism” (三無主義 “Sanmu-shugi”,
meaning “no power, no interest, no responsibility”), “Apathetic
generation” (しらけ世代 “Shirake-sedai”) and so on. However, questions
such as “Why can’t you commit suicide?” and “Why must you live?” have
never been answered.</p>
<p>Closer to home, what is needed now is a book that can make “suicide”
come true.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I remember getting fed up with a book that came
out about 10 years ago that claimed to “describe how to commit suicide”
because it was just filled with nonsense. What you need to know now is
simply how to commit suicide.</p>
<p>In the United States, there is only one euthanasia device, invented
by a scientist (see <a href="#chapter_11">Chapter 11</a>, Case study
30). This book will be the only “purely textual euthanasia device” in
Japan.</p>
<p>At this point, I really want to start the book by describing how
overdose works. However, in order to clarify the answer to “Why commit
suicide now?”, as well as various commercial concerns,<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I
have to write some miscellaneous things first.</p>
<h2 id="chernobyl">Chernobyl</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>… I was waiting for the opportunity, ready to “show something big”.
When the student riots broke out twenty years ago, everyone thought,
“Someone big is about to appear!”. The Apollo landing on the moon, the
oil crisis, the Soviet Union’s invasion of a certain country, and the
Showa era were about to end. I thought, “This move will be
earth-shattering.”. However, it was only a magnitude-3 earthquake, and
it only brought down a wall. The students looked at each other, smiled
and said “Great!” and with that, the gathering came to an end. …</p>
<p>Excerpt from the postscript of <em>Yoake</em> (夜明ケ) by Kotobuki
Shiriagari.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the 1980s, “end of the world” and “dangerous topics”
were trending. The most popular band sang “Chernobyl”<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>,
and children’s jokes were all filled with the flavor of death, girls
began looking for companions in preparation for the coming world war. We
were excited about “Someone powerful is about to appear!” and “Maybe
tomorrow will be the end of the world!”</p>
<p>However, the end of the world did not come. The atomic bomb never
exploded, and the dream of all-out nuclear war disappeared without a
trace. The revolutionaries of the 1980s were thoroughly frustrated.</p>
<p>In the end, everyone finally understood that “showing off their
talents” was impossible to achieve, and the 22nd century would
definitely come. (Of course, the 21st century is coming, because there
will be no “world war”.) The world will definitely not end. Just a brief
encounter with the “other world” and “outside” cannot satisfy our urge.
If you want greater excitement, if you really want the world to end, you
can only do “that thing”.</p>
<h2 id="a-long-vacation">A Long Vacation</h2>
<p>It won’t help to say it’s “boring” - because we are unlucky enough to
be born on this stage of history.</p>
<p>Until the 22nd century, we would get up at seven o’clock every
morning, go to school or go to work, and repeat some unfocused remarks.
At school, I kept reciting English words and historical dates again and
again; at work, I said something like “It’s boring”, but repeated it for
several weeks, one week, one month, and one year. Months and years of
doing work that was actually really boring. The slow pace of
state-of-the-art products continues, the slow pace of politicians
continues to be corrupt, and the slow pace of television content
continues to be exciting. But when I turn off the TV and look around,
it’s just another day as usual. (Evoking “that wonderful darkness that
happens when you turn off the TV” is another of the book’s goals.)</p>
<p>Yukio Mishima<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> mentioned in his autobiographical
novel “Confessions of a Mask” that “everyday life” is more terrifying
than war. We always live this kind of “shivering and terrifying daily
life” enduring it again and again. In order to bring about an
inexplicable “future settlement”. We took every step along the way,
carefully avoiding any deviation in direction. There is no happy ending
like in a TV series. However, the strange “joy” always continues slowly
and slowly. Yes! The key words are “slow steps” and “repetition.” The
constant, slow repetition of the same things; this is the first factor
that increases our death wish.</p>
<h2 id="another-brick-in-the-wall">Another Brick in the Wall</h2>
<p>In 1978, an “Amidakuji suicide incident” occurred in Japan.<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>A pair of highschool twin sisters living in Toyama Prefecture, Japan,
were found hanging in the woods. In the notebook of one of them, an
Amidakuji game was drawn with four straight lines and several horizontal
lines interlaced. Under the Amidakuji, the incomprehensible words “X of
Japanese”, “Suicide”, “ROS”, and “Gosanke” are written respectively. The
line drawn from above goes all the way to the “Suicide” point. Since
their parents could not figure out the motive for their suicide, they
concluded that they committed suicide because the Amidakuji said so. It
is said that “ROS” may have meant “Rolling Stones”, since it also has
words like “Japanese X” and “Hate Asians” written on it, it might have
something to do with it. However, I still can’t understand the meaning
of these words.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, a judge said: “A single human life weights more
than the entire earth.” However, this is an extremely worthless
misunderstanding. As two high school girls in the 1970s have already
realized, a human life is very light, as light as strange words like “X
of Japanese” and “ROS”.</p>
<p>In the late 1950s, an American mass society theorist said: “The
masses have fallen into a sense of powerlessness due to social
atomization.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> In the late 1970s, a British rock
band sang “All in all you’re just another brick in the wall” (Another
Brick in the Wall, 1979 song by Pink Floyd), a song that became very
popular. Even in the 1990s, this situation in Japan has not changed.</p>
<p>As always, every one of us is just another brick in the wall – the
proof is that if any one of us dies, someone will take his place. No
one’s existence is irreplaceable, and no politician is worthy of
assassination. Only one brick missing will not collapse the wall.</p>
<p>Each one of us is full of a sense of powerlessness, and it doesn’t
matter whether we exist or not. In other words, life is light; this is
the second factor that inflates the death wish.</p>
<h2 id="clockwork-orange">Clockwork Orange</h2>
<p>With this sense of powerlessness, we repeatedly do the same things at
a slow pace, forgetting little by little “the reality of being truly
alive”. I have gradually forgotten whether I am alive or dead. Do you
feel that you are “alive”? Now, there is only an almost invisible line
separating life and death.</p>
<p>Therefore, relegate to the sidelines platitudes like”Life is very
important, so you cannot commit suicide.”, “As long as you can live,
everything will turn around.”, “Because people around you will be sad,
so you must live.”. Not convincing anymore. The effective words to stop
suicide have disappeared; signals to guide towards suicide have
appeared.</p>
<p>Yes, you can die. If you go to work or go to school, if life is
uncomfortable, boring, or even painful, you can cross the hair-thin
line, almost invisible, and seek death, and may no one stop you.</p>
<p>As I said before, nothing will change substantially as long as we
live. Although I have no psychic powers, I can generally tell what will
happen to society or ourselves in the future. “The future! The future!”,
no matter how convincing this chant sounds, it is useless. Your life
will probably consist of attending primary school and middle school in
the place of your birth, attending cram schools to study for the
national entrance exam, and then enter a high school or university.
After messing around for four years, you will work in some corporation.
If you are a man, you’d likely get married in your 20s or 30s, have a
child in the next year, perhaps a few job switches or promotions, up to
the position of manager. You will retire at the age of 60, and quietly
cultivate your own hobbies for the next ten or twenty years. Finally,
you will die. That’s it really. Moreover, what makes us despair is that
this is supposedly the most reassuringly ideal life.</p>
<p>In this consideration, ordinary life no longer has any significance.
If you are not alive now, perhaps you are just like a young chicken
ready for roasting, passively given a life that you must live.
Therefore, drawing a pause in life at an appropriate place is not a
matter of “being sad”, “it won’t happen again”, or “worrying about the
ripple effects”.</p>
<p>Suicide is a positive act.</p>
<h2 id="angel-dust">Angel Dust</h2>
<p>I have a friend who has a drug called “angel dust”<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. He
claimed that after taking it, his mind would become hazy, and he can
jump from tall buildings without the slightest hesitation. He packed it
in a small metal pouch, made into a necklace, and wore it everywhere he
went. He said: “When needed, I can eat this to seek death.” My friend
does not have a fixed job, and he is idle every day and has a very happy
life.</p>
<p>I hope this book can be your metal pouch necklace.</p>
<h2 id="another-thing">Another Thing</h2>
<p><em>This section was written by Rena, the Chinese
translator.</em></p>
<p>On the verge of despair, and searching for a way to commit suicide, I
stumbled upon this book and became deeply fascinated by it. Because of
the particularity and age of this book, it took a lot of effort to find
this precious, albeit incomplete, Chinese translation. “Complete the
translation and proofread this book!” was my final wish at the final
moment. Watching the book change from incomplete to complete, I was
filled with a sense of accomplishment, and was able to leave
peacefully.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this book does not mention the more commonly
used method of suicide by burning charcoal, so I privately added a
section on suicide by burning charcoal (in the <a
href="#chapter_6">“Gas-poisoning” chapter</a>) and some other content.
Someone could improve this book, which I think is a motion the original
author would support. In addition, with the passage of time, many drugs
in the <a href="#chapter_1">“Taking medicines” chapter</a> (especially
bromides and barbiturates) have been replaced by relatively less toxic
substances and the control of these substances has become stricter. But
I have still tried my best to list and annotate the ingredients of these
drugs in the hope of helping those in need.</p>
<p>Because my medical and pharmaceutical knowledge is poor, and I am on
the verge of chaos and collapse at the time of proofreading, the
contents of the book inevitably contain errors and omissions. Forgive
me.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank the translator of the Traditional
Chinese version of this book, and everyone who has helped me during this
process. Without you, none of this would be possible today. (Rena,
2018-08-05)</p>

<p>If you can manage it, overdose is the best way to commit suicide.
However, there are so many cases of failures, and excessive preparation
time is a major problem. The degree of pain varies depending on the
drug.</p>
<p>Scattered on the table are capsules and tablets in various colors
such as red, yellow, and blue, or a small pile of snow-white powder.
When you swallow these, you will slowly fall asleep and never wake up
again. This is death as an extended bout of a peaceful sleep, and so it
is the most ideal method of suicide, only reachable through drugs.</p>
<p>Certain drugs control the mind. The brain is the system control
device responsible for the self-organization of the human body. Whether
it is respiratory function or heart beating, the functions of
life-sustaining activities are controlled by the brain. It should be
noted here that the technique used to destroy the entire “self” system
by gradually losing coordination through drugs is a kind of
do-it-yourself lobotomy method.</p>
<p>A substance that cannot ever be fatal cannot be medicine.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of drug, there is an “effective dose”, a “toxic
dose” and a “lethal dose”. Some experts also say, “The dose makes the
poison.” Any drug can kill. It’s just that the gap between the effective
dose and the lethal dose is typically quite large. To reach the lethal
dose, a considerable amount must be swallowed, a difficult task. With
modern pharmaceutical science, this gap has become wider and wider. In
other words, they are safer drugs. What I want to describe here are
those where the gap is narrow.</p>
<p>However, the problem lies in the “lethal dose”. The doses quoted in
this book are the lethal doses of drugs recorded in various literatures,
but it also varies from across literature, and the range is also very
large. At the same time, the lethal dose varies greatly depending on the
individual’s constitution, and whether they take the medicine regularly.
Therefore, there are some people who take a large dose and survive, but
other people who take a small dose but die.</p>
<p>The “lethal dose” that should determine the boundary between life and
death sometimes fails to cause death due to different doses, varying
qualities, and individual differences. So some researchers say that if
you really want to die, just take three times the lethal dose. So we see
that the “lethal dose” does not mean “the dose that kills”. This book
temporarily refers to the midpoint between the minimum and maximum
lethal dosages quoted in the literature (and unless otherwise stated,
all dosages are for adults). This is only a general standard. This
ambiguity about the lethal dose not only point to the blurry line
between life and death, but is also the biggest reason that overdose
suicide is difficult.</p>
<p>However, there are a few more words to say here. You will never die
just by slicing your wrist, but if you take the drugs listed here, you
will actually die. If you just want to have a taste of suicide (which is
not a bad thing), it is better to cut your wrist.</p>
<h2 id="note">Note</h2>
<h3
id="increase-the-absorption-of-digestive-organs-to-avoid-nausea">Increase
the absorption of digestive organs to avoid nausea</h3>
<p>The most important thing to avoid is vomiting out the medication you
have taken. Death from overdose is basically acute chemical poisoning.
Just imagine drinking alcohol. Of course, alcohol poisoning can be
fatal. Often there are cases of college student dying from alcohol
poisoning. However, usually when the body can no longer bear it, it will
vomit it out. It’s just swapping alcohol for drugs. It is natural to
vomit due to a large overdose. So, getting the right amount is very
difficult.</p>
<p>Of course, there are ways to prevent vomiting, which simply enhance
absorption by the digestive organs, just like allopathic treatment.
There is no way to deal with vomiting due to physiological rejection
reaction. In short, you can only try to take it towards the “lethal
dose”, even if it’s just one more tablet.</p>
<h3 id="you-will-not-die-by-overdosing-on-halcyonhalcyon">You will not
die by overdosing on Halcyon<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></h3>
<p>Another thing you should pay attention to is to understand the
“lethal dose” before taking drugs. There are many drugs that can kill.
For example, the sleeping pill Hazard is becoming a hot topic nowadays.
Drowsiness comes quickly and memory may be lost after taking it, so it
seems very dangerous, but it is a very safe drug. A 27-year-old woman
who drank alcohol and swallowed eighty tablets of Halcyon got up like a
sleepwalker after falling asleep, said to her parents, “… go to Lawson
…”<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> and then fell down. She regained
consciousness the next day after being sent to the hospital, and the
results of the examination were normal. Just looking dangerous won’t
kill anyone.</p>
<p>This book does not introduce drugs whose lethal dose is unknown.
Actions without a plan will not only fail but also cause unnecessary
pain. A housewife who swallowed potassium cyanate scratched her chest
all night and was found to be a bloody mess.</p>
<p>By the way, many of the rumors about drug suicide are false. People
often say that it will leave serious sequelae to the internal organs or
brain that will last a lifetime, but judging from the drugs listed in
this book that have an effect on the nervous system, some doctors say
that almost all of them have no such side effects.</p>
<p>There are also “anti-suicide advocates” who claim that health
insurance does not cover the cost of suicide treatment, so it costs a
huge amount of money, but this is also untrue. A 26-year-old woman was
admitted to the hospital after swallowing 20 tablets and 20 packets of
powdered sedatives whose ingredients and dosages are unknown, but which
are considered to be the most powerful drugs in hospitals. She was in a
coma for two days, but she used her insurance card to pay for her
medical bills. Therefore, it is also important to pay attention not to
be deceived by lies.</p>
<h2 id="preparation-intravenous-injection">Preparation: Intravenous
injection</h2>
<p>First, there are various strategies to prevent vomiting. The easiest
way is to place the drug on something like a green wave and bake it with
fire to melt it, or dissolve it with hot water to become an aqueous
solution, and then inject it into the vein with a syringe. In this case,
of course there will be no vomiting, but it will have a greater effect
than gastrointestinal absorption and require much less. If air is mixed
into the syringe, air embolism may occur in the cerebral blood vessels
and lead to death. There are also cases of death caused by shock caused
by foreign matter other than blood mixed into blood vessels. There will
be considerable pain in the blood vessels due to the mixing of foreign
matter. In the case of multiple injections, if the pain is severe, you
can apply a cold compress to the arm. In short, you need to think of
something.</p>
<h2 id="note-1">Note</h2>
<h3 id="the-last-supper">the Last Supper</h3>
<p>For those who want to die by taking medicine instead of injections,
it is necessary to adjust the state of their stomach in advance. In
order to absorb the drug more quickly and effectively cause acute
poisoning, food should not be left in the stomach. But if you are too
fasting, you will have an allergic reaction and vomit. It is difficult
to control the proportion.</p>
<p>About an hour before deciding to commit suicide, you should drink a
cup of black tea, eat a piece of toast, and take some anti-intoxicants.
Tablets should be crushed in advance and put into a grinder to form a
powder. The capsule should be removed, leaving the powder, or placed in
hot water to dissolve into a liquid. Then mix the medicine into pudding
or yogurt, add some honey, and swallow it quickly. But some experts say
mixing the drug in pudding or yogurt won’t speed up absorption. Perhaps
it’s better to think of it as a way to aid swallowing.</p>
<h3 id="drink-some-wine-at-the-same-time">Drink some wine at the same
time</h3>
<p>Drinking some wine at the same time is a must. It is said that
alcohol has a mutually reinforcing effect on drugs that have an effect
on the central nervous system. It can accelerate the dissolution rate of
any drug, and the effect can be increased by 50% when used together. In
addition to wine, it is best to prepare a few more drinks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you must choose a place that others cannot find, and at
least a place where you can stay alone within eight hours. For example,
a hotel is the most suitable. If someone discovers it within a few
hours, it becomes a suicide attempt and requires repeated enemas. A
25-year-old woman who was given an enema for a suicide attempt said, “If
I had known it would be so painful, I would not have committed suicide.”
(However, she also said, “Maybe I will commit suicide again.”)</p>
<p>Once the preparations are complete, let’s start introducing the
drugs.</p>
<h2 id="over-the-counter-medicine">Over-the-counter medicine</h2>
<p>The drugs sold over-the-counter are typically not very toxic.
Professional books say: “[OTC drugs] are almost never fatal if taken in
large amounts in a single dose.” Although this statement cannot be
considered correct, it is indeed difficult to commit suicide by taking
OTC drugs. As mentioned above, drugs have various amounts that produce
effects and cause poisoning. Therefore, medicines that are produced with
low toxicity while maintaining a certain distance from the poisoning
amount are popular medicines. Therefore, it is sold in general
pharmacies. However, the basic points of suicide pills are that they are
“easy to obtain” and “you will fall asleep after taking them.” If you
can’t get it, even introducing it is meaningless. It is necessary to
know that it is difficult to cause death by taking popular medicines,
but in the past, professional books said that “it is almost impossible
to cause death.” In other words, it is not 100% impossible, and this
exception is introduced here.</p>

<p>The “standard name” refers to the name of the active ingredient in
the drug. The “product name” is the trademarked names for trademarked
products produced by specific pharmaceutical companies. For example,
“Aspirin” is a product name for drugs with the active substance of
“acetylsalicylic acid”.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s after the war, there was a second sleeping
pill suicide craze. Mainly young people in their twenties, the number of
people who commit suicide by taking sleeping pills greatly exceeds the
number of people who hang themselves. Bromovalerylurea was sold under
the brand name “Burobarin” (ブロバリン), and was the main drug for the
second suicide craze. At the time when Ryūnosuke Akutagawa committed
suicide by taking sleeping pills in 1926, causing the first suicide
craze, bromovalerylurea was sold under the name “Calmotin” (カルモチン),
and widely used. Osamu Dazai also used Calmotin to make several lover’s
double suicide attempts. Therefore, it is clear that bromovalerylurea is
a long-standing suicide drug in Japan.</p>
<p>Currently, bromovalerylurea is designated as a “drug that must be
used under a doctor’s instruction” and cannot be purchased without a
doctor’s prescription. “Risuron S” (リスロンS) (Sato Pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd.) sold on the market has the same ingredients and dosage as
Burobarin. Obviously this is legal. Because the amount of
bromovalerylurea in each tablet is less than 500mg and can be sold.
These are 8mm-diameter tablets, white in color and bitter in taste.</p>
<p>When the conditions are ripe, as long as a lethal dose is taken, the
central nervous system will fall under the drugs’ effect, (the
excitatory powers of the brain and spinal cord nerves will fail), and
consciousness will be lost quickly. Death will occur mainly due to
respiratory arrest in about an hour. Someone died after taking 50
tablets of burobarin (Case study 2), but it is still appropriate to take
200 tablets. 200 tablets is enough to fill both hands. If this is all
that’s needed amount, then there is no need to mix it with yogurt (Case
study 1).</p>
<p>In addition, medicines that contain 100 mg of bromovalerylurea in one
tablet include “Muurumin” (ム－ルミン, by Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd.), “Day and Night” (Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), etc. “Risuron
S” is made purely from bromovalerylurea, but others contain some
caffeine and other ingredients. Because it contains other active
ingredients, the total dosage increases, and the possibility of vomiting
increases.</p>
<p>In addition, the acetaminophen, mentioned later, is often sold in
tablets that also contain 150 mg of bromovalerylurea. If you take 100 to
200 tablets equivalent to the lethal dose of bromovalerylurea, you will
also reach the lethal dose zone of acetaminophen. This is double the
lethal dose and even more dangerous.</p>
<h5 id="how-to-buy">How to buy</h5>
<p>The instruction manual for “Risuron S” says that it is “a drug that
has a sedative effect on anxiety and tension.” You can buy it by simply
repeating the symptoms to the pharmacy, but the biggest problem is how
to buy 10 to 20 boxes of that. Most pharmacies would have not that much
stock, and pharmaceutical companies don’t typically sell that much to
pharmacies, so you can’t buy enough all at once. In some cases, the
product may not be sold due to the judgment of the pharmacy. Pharmacies
near major stations generally have supplies. You can look for about five
of them and bought them every half month, and get twenty boxes in two
months. You can take 2 to 3 tablets of this medicine every day, and
since there are only 12 tablets in the box, so it is not surprising to
buy it every ten days. However, in order to prevent abuse, pharmacies
sometimes do not sell it, or ask about symptoms, or refer you to the
hospital. A pharmacy staff member said: “I won’t sell to anyone who
looks wrong.” In this case, you can explain that “I don’t want to go to
the doctor.” or “It would be terrible if my colleagues (classmates) know
that I are not mentally healthy.” The same goes for drug abuse. If you
can’t find a pharmacy that sells it, call the pharmaceutical company and
they will tell you which ones sell it.</p>

to 600 capsules, that is, 3 to 30 boxes. As mentioned before, “get it,
take it and fall asleep” is the condition for sleeping suicide pills,
and this “Atarax-P” (produced by Pfizer) is the drug with the best
conditions. The lethal dose is 25 to 250 mg per kilogram of body weight.
The range is too large and it is a vague guess. Therefore, a person
weighing 60 kilograms can take 600 tablets.</p>
<p>Just placing 600 small green capsules in front of you will give you
an illusion that “it looks like a lot”, but the ingredient in one
capsule are only 20mg. There is yellow powder in the capsule, and when
you take them out and pour together, it is only a quarter of the size of
a small bowl. This amount is easy to take without mixing it in
yogurt.</p>
<p>Hydroxylammonium chloride has the effect of inhibiting the central
nervous system and stabilizing the autonomic nervous system. When taken
in large amounts, sleepiness, fatigue, dizziness, and eventually death
due to respiratory arrest may occur. Be sure to take it with alcohol.
The inhibitory effect on the central nervous system will be enhanced,
and the effect will be better if the body is cooled at this time.</p>
<p>Drugs with the exact same ingredients include “Jisuron P” (ジスロンP,
Imperial Chemical Co., Ltd.) and “Bobusuuru” (ボブス－ル, Kato
Suisatsudo Co., Ltd.). Atarax-P is available in packs of 100
tablets.</p>
<p>However, a 40-year-old woman who took 100 tablets of Atarax-P and
drank a bottle of beer and a glass of whiskey lost consciousness and
vomited 17 hours later. She was found and sent to the hospital. She
recovered and was discharged two days later. All in all, think twice and
take more.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, there was a popular game of “drinking cough drops in
one gulp and then jumping like crazy”. This is because cough drops
contain anesthetic substances such as codeine, which acts on the cough
center in the brain to relieve coughs, and ephedrine, which dilates the
trachea. Codeine is a component of opium, and although the lethal dose
of ephedrine is unknown, it is a raw material for stimulants, so it is
very dangerous. It should be banned, but it will not stop coughing if
you don’t use it. Therefore, most of the cough suppressants sold now
contain these two ingredients.</p>
<p>“Paburon-S” (Taisho Pharmaceutical) is also one of this type of
drugs. In the 1980s, “Buron liquid” (SS Pharmaceuticals) was widely
used, but now this medicine does not contain ephedrine, so here is
dihydrocodeine phosphate, which has an almost identical structure to
codeine. 30 mg and “Paburon” of dimethylephedrine hydrochloride (methyl
ephedrine), the sister ingredient of ephedrine. Codeine phosphate can
cause drowsiness when taken in large amounts, while ephedrine has a
wakefulness effect. Overall, it is not so much sleep as it is a strong
excitatory effect, leading to increased heart rate, accelerated
breathing and death due to circulatory insufficiency. In addition, cough
suppressants containing 30 mg of dihydrocodeine include “New Deni Cough
Liquid” and “New Dihydrocodeine Cough Liquid” (Kowa).</p>
<p>The content of dimethylephedrine hydrochloride in “Aneton Granules”
(by Pfizer) is 10 mg. In the book <em>Final Exit</em>, it’s stated that
codeine lethal dose is 2.4 g, so just believe it and take more than 240
granules, which is just a small bowl in terms of quantity. An expert’s
opinion is: “Things mixed with yogurt and the like” have white particles
and a sweet taste.</p>

<p>Antiemetics, surprisingly, contain many dangerous ingredients. After
a 24-year-old woman took 7.5g of dimenhydrinate in order to have an
abortion, she developed vomiting, dizziness, convulsions, fell into a
coma, and died due to respiratory insufficiency 90 minutes later.
“Rakkumoa” (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) contains pyridoxine
hydrochloride 7 mg and caffeine anhydrous 14 mg in addition to
dimenhydrinate, making it easier to obtain than pure dimenhydrinate
medicine. This is a slightly larger tablet with a three-layer structure
of white, blue and white. Drugs containing 50mg of Dimenhydrinate
include “Carax” (Kyoei Pharmaceutical), “Dimenhydrinate”, “Moder” (Moder
Pharmaceutical), “Drive Soft” (Choseido Pharmaceutical), etc. There are
several types, and they are also sold in pharmacies. In addition, if you
can die by taking at least 30 tablets, it is perfect for suicide.</p>
<p>The problem with taking this drug is sleeping well. As mentioned
earlier, this drug affects the central nervous system and causes
respiratory arrest. Side effects include drowsiness, headache, etc.
However, since it is not a psychotropic drug, it cannot fall asleep
quickly. If you must sleep, you can use sleeping pills on the market
together.</p>
<p>However, there are also cases of 20-year-old and 22-year-old men who
took 800mg of dimenhydrinate and experienced hallucinations but did not
die.</p>

<p>“Can the famous ‘Travelmin Senior’ also kill people?” Some people may
have questions. The ingredients of “Travelmin Senior” are 40 mg of
diphenhydramine and 26 mg of diprophylline. There are not many other
ingredients, and the dangerous ingredient diphenhydramine accounts for
the largest proportion. There are also many others that contain
ingredients that prevent drowsiness such as caffeine. Diphenhydramine
acts as an antihistamine, causing a mixture of central nervous system
depression and excitement symptoms. Produces severe brain stimulation
and severe loss of consciousness. However, antihistamines have a
hypnotic effect. It is forbidden to drive a vehicle after taking them.
If you take them in large amounts, you will fall asleep.</p>

<p>The advantage of anti-vomiting and anti-sickness medicine is that
people think that “No one would commit suicide using that kind of
medicine.” When you go to buy something, you can say, “I want to buy
more medicine to prevent motion sickness because I’m going on a long
trip.” and the pharmacy won’t be suspicious. Senpaa (Taisho
Pharmaceutical) only has six tablets in a box. If you want to buy 200
tablets, you only need 33 boxes. There is no need to worry.</p>
<p>Scopolamine hydrobromide has a parasympathetic nervous system
inhibitory effect and can inhibit breathing if taken in large amounts.
Side effects include drowsiness, confusion, hallucinations, difficulty
swallowing, etc. It is questionable whether you will fall asleep
immediately after taking it. There are many drugs containing scopolamine
hydrobromide to prevent motion sickness. Among the drugs currently
available on the market, Senpaa has the highest content of scopolamine
and does not contain other unnecessary ingredients. It is a large tablet
with a diameter of one centimeter. Take 200 tablets and break them to a
fine powder. It is not bitter.</p>

<p>“Taisho Tonpuku” (Taisho Pharmaceutical) and “Ron Sampo Capsules A”
(Sampo Pharmaceutical) contain 300 mg of acetaminophen, which has a
sedative and antipyretic effect. Ingesting large amounts can cause
drowsiness, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness. In
the end, it endangers the liver and leads to death. It cannot be said
that it is a sleeping pill. However, one pack of Taisho Tonpuku contains
200mg of bromovalerylurea, so it is easy to fall asleep. The precautions
for the drug also state that it “may cause drowsiness” and it is
forbidden to drive a car or operate machinery after taking it. It is a
small white granule with a bitter taste but a cooling sensation in the
mouth after taking it.</p>
<p>Analgesics such as “Noushin Arakusu” also contain 300mg of
acetaminophen in one bag. There are many other complexes, but this one
has the advantage of “you can buy a lot at once”. If you want to list
acetaminophen-containing detoxification and analgesics, there are too
many to mention. There are many on the market, so you might as well buy
them in lethal doses. For example, a 49-year-old woman took 30 tablets
of of “SEDES A” (80 mg of acetaminophen, 100 mg of bromovalerylurea, 200
mg of ethylsulfamide, 25 mg of anhydrous caffeine) caused liver and
kidney failure. After sixteen days of excitement and lethargy, she died
due to respiratory arrest. The woman who died after taking only 30
tablets (acetaminophen 2.4g) was lucky. Among the ingredients in “SEDES
A”, the one that causes the most severe side effects is acetaminophen.
The “New SEDES A” currently sold (Shionogi Pharmaceuticals) use
allylisopropylacetylurea <sup>10</sup> 30mg and caffeine 40mg instead of
bromovalerylurea, and the other ingredients remain unchanged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>8</sup> Acetaminophen: over-the-counter analgesic and
fever-reducing drug. Taking more than 7.5 g/day or 150 mg/kg may cause
liver damage.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup> Ethenzamide: salicylic acid antipyretic and analgesic.
The analgesic effect is similar to that of salicylic acid derivatives
such as aspirin, but side effects can cause liver and kidney damage. The
LD50 when administered orally to mice is 549 mg/kg</p>
<p><sup>10</sup> Allylisopropylacetylurea: sedative drug that has a
depressive effect on the central nervous system and is addictive.</p>

<p>Some people think that “drinking coffee all the time” and not caring
much about caffeine is bad. Caffeine stimulates the vasomotor center and
respiratory center in the brain, strengthens the muscle contraction of
the heart, and is a highly stimulating agent. Drinking large amounts can
cause excitement, increased blood pressure, ventricular fibrillation (a
phenomenon in which the ventricles in the lower part of the heart
contract), cardiopulmonary arrest, and death. Aspirin stimulates the
central nervous system and metabolic system such as the respiratory
center, leading to rapid breathing, metabolic abnormalities, high fever,
death due to respiratory failure or shock, and damage to the kidneys.
Both have stimulant effects and will never cause sleep after taking
them, but they are introduced because they are easy to obtain and can
cause death in small amounts. It is an unforgettable medicine for people
who want to die peacefully. For example, a 21-year-old female student
who took 100 tablets (50 g) of 500 mg aspirin experienced various
symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, excitement, shortness of breath, and
lethargy. About nineteen hours later, she suffered from respiratory
failure, collapsed, and died. Judging from the above examples, the time
from taking aspirin to death is quite short.</p>
<p>Caffeine and aspirin, which were introduced because they contain the
least unnecessary ingredients, are commercialized in large quantities,
such as “Estalon Mocha” (エスタロンモカ, coffee-colored tablets,
extremely bitter taste) and aspirin tablets (used to be a trademark for
acetylsalicylic acid, but has long fallen into generic use). There are
“Coffee Soft Tablets” (エカ－フェソフト錠, produced by Eezai エ－ザイ),
“Coffee Cool Tablets” (カフェク－ル, produced by Arakusu アラクス) and
other medicines that prevent dozing off. For aspirin, there are
antipyretic analgesics with aspirin as the main ingredient, such as
“Grandol” (グランド－ル, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) and “New
Grelan A” (新グレランA, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.).</p>

id="case-study-1-a-young-salesman-who-posted-an-article-to-a-newspaper-announcing-his-suicide">Case
study 1: A young salesman who posted an article to a newspaper
announcing his suicide</h3>
<p>On 1956-08-02, at around 10 in the evening, a movie theater in Mejiro
District, Tokyo, was showing two movies in succession. The receptionist
noticed that a young man was still sleeping, so she planned to wake him
up, but found that the man was already cold. He slowly swallowed 200
tablets of Brovarin<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> and 30 tablets of Adorm<a
href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> while drinking alcohol. After being
rushed to the hospital immediately, he slept for a whole day and night,
and died early on the 4th.</p>
<p>He was born in Tokyo and was 23 years old when he died. He dropped
out of Tokyo University of Fisheries and worked for a pharmaceutical
company for four and a half years, mainly in packaging and delivery. His
brother is also a pharmacist at a pharmaceutical company, and he
probably got the lethal dose of the drug and the method of taking it
from there.</p>
<p>On July 28 of the previous month, on the same day that he resigned
from the pharmaceutical company due to “personal reasons”, he started
promoting “buy now, pay in installments later” in a department store.
However, he was extremely dissatisfied with the company’s policy that if
the target performance was not achieved, all commissions would be owned
by the company. On August 1, the day before his suicide, he sent a
letter to the <em>Asahi Shimbun</em>’s submission column that read “That
day, when I leave this world, I loudly call out this company’s illegal
practices.” A letter, in other words, that announced his own death.</p>
<p>He wrote in his suicide note to the director of the department store,
“Before I decided to do something that I had already decided on, I just
encountered the department store by chance. Though the law of the jungle
existed in this society, I do not blame its existence on the low-level
people in the organization…” This shows that he did not commit suicide
in order to accuse the company of injustice. He was a cheerful man with
a philosophical side. The motive behind this young man’s suicide, who
once locked himself in a room to write a detective novel, remains
unknown.</p>
<h4 id="check-the-cause-of-death">Check: the cause of death</h4>
<p>What needs to be tested here is not the strange behavior he took
before death, but that he swallowed 200 tablets of Brovarin and 30
tablets of Adorm. He took a large amount of sleeping pills such as
barbituric acid without vomiting them up, and completed his suicide.
Normally, swallowing such a large number of tablets would result in
vomiting them out. This is one of the shortcomings of committing suicide
by taking poison. He probably swallowed them bit by bit during the two
hours or more of the movie’s release, and proved that if you take in
little bits and swallow, you won’t spit it out.</p>
<p>Brovarin was sold only in units of 100 mg. He swallowed 20 grams,
which was enough to reach a lethal dose of 10 – 30 grams. It is said
that if you drink alcohol with these sleeping pills, the effect will be
ten times greater. He probably heard this from his brother.</p>
<h3
id="case-study-2-a-student-who-took-50-tablets-of-brovarin-and-left-a-record-of-death">Case
study 2: A student who took 50 tablets of Brovarin and left a “record of
death”</h3>
<p>In May 1972, a 20-year-old student slipped from his chair in his room
and died. There is a suicide note on the table in his room, a brand new
notebook titled “The Last Moments”, which begins with “I did not escape
from this society due to the influence of the so-called misanthropy. The
reason why I want to disappear now is because I feel that now It was the
right time that made me decide to commit suicide.”</p>
<p>What’s even more strange is that he wrote in detail the process from
swallowing the drug until he lost consciousness in his college
notebook.</p>
<p>“It is now 1972-05-19, 10:07 in the afternoon. I swallowed 50
Brovarin tablets two or three minutes ago. I don’t know how many minutes
or hours later I will fall asleep and be with this Farewell to society,
but I will observe my own death until the last moment… 10:15, and I
don’t want to sleep at all. I turned on the radio and listened for a
while, then turned it off. I wanted to stay calm but I was still
excited, as usual. The music I used to love sounds so boring today. I
want to review my life carefully… (what follows are five sheets of
description of his parents and friends)… 11:30. I have been yawning
since just now. I see the last moment coming. But I want to observe the
mood of death until the last moment, so I keep telling myself to
persist. I don’t know when my body will be found, but I want to see my
own desire It keeps coming up. … Now, 12 o’clock, and I, 5 minutes”</p>
<p>The note ended here, and it was about this time that he lost
consciousness.</p>
<h4 id="check-the-cause-of-death-1">Check: the cause of death</h4>
<p>Brovarin 50 tablets are equivalent to 5 grams of bromovalerylurea,
which is much lower than the lethal dose, but I don’t think the young
man is lying, so I know that he will die even if he swallows such a
large amount. At the same time, I also learned that swallowing 50
tablets of Brovarin will slowly increase sleepiness, and you will not
wake up after falling asleep for about two hours. There was no pain at
all until he lost consciousness, and his consciousness was very clear.
Of course, this will vary greatly depending on your physical strength
and health. If you fall down immediately, you will probably fall asleep
in a shorter time.</p>
<p>His suicide can really be said to be an “experiment.” Regarding
leaving a record, he wrote: “To die without leaving anything behind can
easily be misunderstood as the result of melancholy that is often the
case at my age. I do not want to be misunderstood in any way, so I am
here calmly Leave me to look carefully at my own evidence.” However, we
have no idea of ​​his motive for committing suicide, so we can only think
that he died “to try out how he would feel when he died.”</p>
<p>No matter what, the record I wrote while holding the pen until I was
about to lose consciousness is extremely precious. After the last “five
minutes”, I should probably write “Then it’s time to fall asleep.”</p>
<p>In addition, as an example of taking bromovalerylurea, a 22-year-old
woman who swallowed 50 tablets of five kinds of drugs containing
bromovalerylurea, was found and treated twelve hours after taking it,
and continued in a semi-asleep state. Ten days later, she died of heart
failure and complicated nephritis.</p>
<p>Also, two 15-year-old female students who had swallowed 100 tablets
of Brovarin (thus, 10 grams per student) were found staggering while
walking and were taken to the hospital by ambulance. They regained
consciousness five hours later and fully recovered.</p>
<h2 id="controlled-substances">Controlled substances</h2>
<p>For drugs that may be abused as recreational drugs or used to commit
suicide, the Ministry of Health and Welfare defines them as potent
drugs, poisons, indicated drugs, designated pharmaceuticals, etc., and
does not allow the general public to obtain them. What I want to
introduce here are these “restricted pharmaceuticals”. Just because it’s
not easy to obtain doesn’t mean it’s impossible to get. Maybe someone
already has a prescription, so I’m introducing it here.</p>
<p>[Translator’s note: As the levels of control differs by locale and
time, I did not translate the level of control given in the book, which
is only true for Japan in 1990s. Check your local laws and

<p>Recently, some psychiatrists have been prescribing drugs
indiscriminately. When you open the door to mental medicine and tell the
doctor that you “can’t sleep” or “feel restless”, there is a high
possibility that an anti-anxiety drug such as “Serushin” or “Diazepam”
will be prescribed immediately. Sometimes internal medicine will also
prescribe this. After getting an anti-anxiety prescription from a
psychiatrist, you say “It didn’t work.” and ask for a change of
medication. Because doctors also need to try which one is more suitable
for patients.</p>
<p>However, just because doctors prescribe Benzodiazepam series drugs
first, it also shows that they are very safe. Even if you are lucky
enough to get such a prescription, the effect is small and the distance
between it and the lethal dose is too large. In order to get the lethal
dose, you have to go to the hospital frequently. The prescribed amount
is no more than 15 mg per day, so at least a month’s worth of medicine
needs to be accumulated. Furthermore, doctors had worried that the drugs
they prescribed could be accumulated and used for suicide. Precisely
because it is easy to obtain, it is not suitable for suicide. There are
two cases where two patients who swallowed an estimated 450 to 500 mg of
Diazepam recovered within 48 hours.</p>
<p>Although the brand names such as “Serenamin” and “Kurashina” are
different, their active ingredients are all Diazepams. Sometimes when
you don’t understand what medicine the doctor prescribes, you can refer
to books such as “Doctor’s Guide to Prescription Medicines”.</p>
<h3 id="antidepressants">Antidepressants</h3>
<p><img src="img/1_antidepressants.png" /></p>
<p>Antidepressant drugs such as Tofranil are suitable for those
conditions where anti-anxiety drugs do not work, such as extreme
depression and insomnia. It’s harder to get than anti-anxiety
medications, but you can get a prescription if you tell your doctor
you’re having trouble sleeping, the anti-anxiety medications aren’t
working, etc. It can even mean you want to commit suicide. If you really
fall into a depressed state, you will sometimes be cheerful and
sometimes lively. Once the medication is discontinued, you will return
to the original state.</p>

<p>This is a list of antidepressants that all have similar properties.
Taking large amounts can cause headaches, dizziness, and drowsiness.
Sometimes it can cause confusion, hallucinations, and usually fall
asleep quickly. But cramps in the hands and feet are a common poisoning
effect. Although it is not thought to cause damage to internal organs,
there are examples of effects on the liver. If CNS depressants and
alcohol are used together, the effect will be enhanced.</p>

<p>Although “Insumin” is not an anti-anxiety agent or an
anti-depressant, it is commonly prescribed by doctors as a sleeping
pill. Of course, taking a large amount will create a state of
excitement, but due to the suppression of the central nervous system,
you will soon fall asleep and die due to respiratory arrest. Likewise,
the combined use of alcohol and other central nervous system depressant
drugs can increase its effects.</p>
<h3 id="wintermin-kontomin-コントミン">Wintermin, Kontomin

<p>Very powerful sedatives. Most people will feel intense drowsiness
soon after taking just one tablet. A 21-year-old college student fell
asleep after taking a tablet of “Wintermin” during a lecture. When he
woke up, the next class had begun. In other words, he was unaware of the
movements of the people around him and slept for more than five
hours.</p>

<p>“Wintermin” and “Kontomin” are powerful sedatives. This drug is used
for patients with severe symptoms, not neurosis but schizophrenia, so it
is more difficult to obtain, but it is very lethal. This drug also
depresses the central nervous system, and the cause of death is
respiratory arrest. It is important to swallow a lethal amount of
medication before sleepiness sets in.</p>
<p>However, there are also examples of people being rescued after
swallowing 9.75 g. Symptoms of poisoning are: persistent high fever,
disturbance of consciousness, difficulty breathing, circulatory
collapse, and dehydration, followed by death due to acute renal
failure.</p>

<p>These will kill you if you ingest them. The range between the
effective dose and the lethal dose is extremely small. It is said that
if you take even a small amount, you will fall asleep and die. The
European and American Euthanasia Association also strongly recommends
this drug. However, it is 100% impossible to obtain. Because it was from
a long time ago, it is almost not used in Japan at present. Even if it
is prescribed, it is only used by people with extremely severe symptoms.
However, it is possible to obtain it overseas, so I will introduce it
here.</p>

<p>These are sleeping pills belonging to the barbiturates family,
extremely dangerous drugs that can cause heart and respiratory arrest
and death if taken in large amounts. Symptoms of poisoning include
headache, convulsions, mental confusion, etc. If you take a large
amount, you will suddenly fall into coma. If you can get your hands on
it, there is no better suicidal drug than this.</p>
<p>If you plan to buy overseas, you should remember the generic name
because the product name is not universal. It is said that the
regulations in the Netherlands are relatively loose.</p>
<p>However, there are also the following examples. A fifty-one-year-old
doctor estimated that he swallowed 20g of phenobarbital powder and fell
into a coma for four days. Later, he regained consciousness through
artificial dialysis. After continuing to have delusions, fantasies, and
excitement, after a period of Month, I was discharged from the hospital
without any mental impairment.</p>
<p>For such drugs, which are almost unavailable and whose lethal doses
are known, a list is provided at the end of this chapter for
reference.</p>
<h2 id="recreational-drugs">Recreational drugs</h2>
<p>Some recreational drugs are the most lethal. Compared with other
pharmaceuticals, their lethal dose can be very small. However, there are
some reservations about recommending those as suicide drugs.</p>
<p>I have no idea how to get it. Even if someone told me that “there are
clubs frequented by foreigners where you can get it”, it is usually
impossible to know which club it is and who will sell it to me. Even if
you get it, how many impurities will it contain? Besides, I have no idea
what kind of recreational drugs I could get there.</p>
<p>At the same time, depending on whether the body is used to it, the
toxic effects and lethal doses vary greatly. Originally, the lethal dose
varies from person to person, and it is even more obvious when it comes
to recreational drugs. Chronic poisoning is not suitable for the general
lethal dose (some records say it is ten times). There is no other way to
kill this kind of death except ingesting a large amount. This means that
recreational drugs are not suitable for planned suicide. Because of
this, what follows is solely for the eyes of those who can get it, or
already have it, and know its ingredients.</p>

<p>There was once a question: “Should I stop stimulants, or should I
stop my life?” The correct answer should be “I should stop my life by
stimulants.”</p>
<p>Immediately after the Second World War, the drug that started a
stimulant craze was commercially sold under the name “Hiropon”
(ヒロポン).<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Today it is called “Shabu” (シャブ)
or “Speed” (スピード) and is widely used by gangsters and even club
youths, and it is this recreational drugs that still occupies the throne
of the Japanese recreational drugs industry. Amphetamine (amphetamine)
is mainly used in Europe and the United States, and the inventor of
methamphetamine (Hiropon) is a Japanese, and it later became widely
spread around the world and became Japan’s representative recreational
drugs. It might as well be said that Hiropon means “love of work” in
Greek (Φιλόπονος filóponos).</p>
<p>Stimulants stimulate the central nervous system, especially the
brain, improving concentration and desire for activity. When a lethal
dose of metafetamine was injected intravenously for the first time, the
patient’s heart beat rapidly within seconds to tens of seconds,
autonomic nervous system abnormalities occurred, sweating, deep and
accelerated breathing, dilated pupils, and death due to circulatory
organ failure. Sometimes it can cause brain hemorrhage. The effect is
reduced if consumed, so it must be injected intravenously.</p>
<p>However, for people who have become accustomed to it, even taking 0.5
to 1g a day will not cause death. A 27-year-old woman fell into a coma
after taking 2g of methamphetamine. Her pupils were dilated and her
facial muscles twitched violently, so she was admitted to the hospital.
She recovered and was discharged eleven days later. It can be considered
that she can tolerate the drug very well. On the contrary, there are
also cases of death after taking only 1.5mg. I don’t think anyone will
try it, but avoid using it together with calming substances like
“Serushin” or “Wintermin”, because the effect will be reduced.</p>

<p>According to a 1984 survey conducted by American Women’s Magazine,
one-third of women under the age of 25 have used cocaine. This is an
American narcotic drug in which interest is still on the rise. There
have been no reports of deaths from cocaine. The lethal dose is much
higher than that of other recreational drugs, making it less suitable
for suicide.</p>
<p>It has a stimulating effect on the central nervous system and makes
breathing deeper. Its pharmacological effects are considered to be
roughly the same as stimulants. Usually the powder is inhaled through
the nose, but the effect is much greater when given intravenously. It is
said that, in general, for acute poisoning, death will occur within
three hours after use. The state of consciousness in the near-death
state is the same as that of drugs other than hallucinogens. Even if you
have a slight headache, you are conscious and will think calmly, “This
is not good” and “I can’t die like this.” Regular users will not die
even if they take 1.5 to 2 g per day.</p>
<p>Cocaine is the main component of coca tree leaves. If you want to buy
it overseas, you should buy it in Colombia, the country of origin.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, these three types of drugs are considered to be
completely different, but in fact they have the same ancestor.</p>
<p>Opium is made from the emulsion obtained from the unripe peel of
opium poppy and dried into powder. It is composed of more than 20 kinds
of plant salts such as codeine. Among them, morphine, which has the
largest content and accounts for 4 to 20%, becomes the main component,
and heroin is the most powerful one after chemical treatment. Of course,
the order of potency is heroin, morphine, and opium. The strength of
heroin is considered to be ten times that of morphine. The poisoning
effect is roughly the same, and if it can be obtained, heroin is the
most reliable in causing death.</p>
<p>Contrary to cocaine, these stimulants can inhibit the central nervous
system and cause a trance of pleasure. They are called a series of
depressants. If excessive inhalation or injection occurs, dizziness,
nausea and vomiting will occur within tens of seconds, blood pressure
and body temperature will gradually drop, breathing will be suppressed,
and death will occur due to respiratory arrest within 6 to 12 hours
after falling into coma. Kidney failure from heroin is fatal. Rumor has
it that the punk rocker Sid Vicious died from heroin overdose.</p>
<p>Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, etc. are all major producing areas, and of
course they are easily available.</p>
<h3 id="cocktail-speedball">Cocktail: speedball</h3>
<p>Mixing it with other recreational drugs will create a synergistic
effect and be more lethal, such as sleeping pills. It is generally
believed that if you mix drugs that inhibit the central nervous system,
it will be more likely to cause death. However, in the world of
recreational drugs, the inhibitory series of cocaine and The stimulating
series of heroin, commonly known as “fast balls”, are particularly
dangerous when mixed and inhaled or injected. The use of this type of
mixture will cause a cross between stimulating and inhibiting effects on
the central nervous system. The heart will beat violently and then
suddenly feel like it is about to stop. This phenomenon occurs
repeatedly within a few seconds. The cause of death was cardiac arrest,
a perfect cocktail for suicide. In addition, the stimulant series of
stimulants and codeine, a mixture of stimulants and LSD, are said to be
quite stimulating.</p>

<p>This is a drug that acts very quickly with a very small amount of 20
to 250 micrograms (one millionth of a gram), and the lethal dose is
incomparably less. Of all the drugs listed in this book, the lethal dose
is the lowest.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"

<p>So will he die soon? it’s not true. Usually, the LSD on the market is
diluted hundreds of times and soaked into paper, which requires taking a
large amount of this paper.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, hallucinations are caused by stimulating drugs,
and large amounts of them can cause heart palpitations. At the same
time, the head becomes panicked, and sometimes the person jumps out of
the window and dies due to this. Even so, if used in normal dosage, it
will cause less harm to the human body than other recreational
drugs.</p>
<h2 id="non-pharmaceuticals">Non-pharmaceuticals</h2>
<p>What we introduce here are the “poisons” that are everywhere around
you.</p>
<p>Of course, many people have a desire to die immediately, even if
euthanasia is not possible. For these people, this book also introduces
the methods of “suicide by vehicles” and “self-immolation” that are
definitely not a “good-death” (etymology of “eu-thanasia”). The same
goes for drugs. Even if you don’t die by sleeping, you can die in
momentary agony. For you who plan to end your life, it is too
troublesome to get those drugs that are not easy to obtain. If you can’t
be bothered to decide if you would have to go to work or school
tomorrow, then, I don’t know, why not take these no-preparation-needed
substances listed in below.</p>
<p>The pharmacological effects are generally described here, but a
poisoning expert believes that “such things have no pharmacological
effects.” That is to say, most people will make a “yueee” sound
immediately after swallowing it, have ulcers in their throat and
stomach, and die of pain.</p>
<p>The method of swallowing is not explained one by one, except that the
content is stated in some exceptions. It’s not like it’s a yogurt-mix
you can eat in an aour.</p>
<p>But the lethal dose must be known. The harmful ingredients contained
in these products vary. Although the dosage is not stated, if you want
to know the ingredients of each product, you can call the place of sale
to ask. Calculate from the lethal dose, then swallow. Err on the side of
swallowing too much than too little.</p>
<p>Let’s first list some things that look like they may cause death, but
are actually very un-toxic and not suitable for suicide, including
desiccant silica gel, synthetic detergent, shampoo, hair conditioner,
pomade, ink, and plastic wrap. , mosquito coils, cockroach-catching
mats, deodorants, para-dichlorobenzene insect repellents, etc.,
household bleach, quicklime used as a desiccant. Coumarin series and
rodenticides cannot be used due to poor toxicity. In addition, lipstick,
toothpaste, body wash, and other products that may enter the body
through the mouth are naturally safe. Toothpaste is harmless if you
swallow the entire tube, even if you have the urge to commit suicide. No
matter how much you swallow, you would merely feel stomache upsets.</p>

<p>The nicotine contained in short cigarettes HOPE, HI-LITE and other
cigarettes is much more toxic than generally imagined. For a baby,
sometimes one or two can be fatal. Professional books describe it as “a
poison comparable to cyanide”.</p>
<p>Currently sold cigarettes, short HOPE contains 1.6 mg, HI-LITE
contains 1.6mg, and short PEACE contains 2.7 mg of nicotine. It contains
more nicotine than cigars, but it is ineffective due to the burning of
nicotine when smoking. Of course, you can also eat the tobacco leaves,
but soaking the tobacco leaves in water to dissolve the nicotine will
make the absorption faster and more effective. After the tobacco leaves
are soaked in water, 50-70% of the nicotine will dissolve within one
hour. When you plan to ingest 60 mg of nicotine, you can soak 44 short
PEACE sticks in water, since the 50% dissolved out of it would be
enough. After one hour drink it. If you boil it in a pot, nearly 70-100%
can be dissolved in a short time. However, heat of one hundred degrees
will not destroy nicotine, and it will dissolve faster when placed in
alcohol. The cigarette solution is very bitter, so adding some sugar
would be a good idea.</p>
<p>While nicotine initially stimulates the central nervous system, such
as motor nerves, it excites and then produces an inhibitory effect.
Immediately after taking it, you would felt burning pain in throat,
nausea, regurgitation, and headache, and soon became paralyzed and
confused. Death due to respiratory arrest. After taking a lethal dose,
paralysis occurs without excitement, and the person falls into a state
of collapse, and will die in an instant.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is that nicotine has strong nauseating effects
and is best taken with medication to prevent nausea. Of course, if this
solution is injected into a vein, the effect is stronger and there is no
need to worry about vomiting.</p>

<p>Of course, drugs that kill worms can also be harmful to humans. There
are naphthalene ball, camphor powder, etc. The amount of camphor in
“Fujisawa camphor” (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Industry) is 252 grams per
box. Symptoms of poisoning include headache, vomiting, confusion,
fatigue, etc., and in severe cases, drowsiness. The liver and kidneys
can also be injured.</p>
<p>Today’s insect repellents are mainly based on the relatively safe
para-dichlorobenzene, while tea and camphor are gradually disappearing.
Naphthalene is more toxic than camphor. Cockroach killers such as
“Cockroach Killer Boric Acid Balls” and “Cockroach Killer” all contain
the harmful ingredient boric acid. Boric acid inhibits the central
nervous system. When taken in large amounts, symptoms such as headache,
vomiting, weakness, drowsiness, and lethargy may occur, and death may
occur due to circulatory insufficiency. It can also cause disorders to
the kidneys and liver. If you are worried about the sequelae, you should
take a large amount to prevent suicide attempts. Bleach and other
chemicals also contain boric acid.</p>
<p>Insecticide sprays turn into liquid when sprayed into the air, making
them easy to drink. Products such as “Ujitouru”, “Torazouru”,
“Pirezooru” among pesticides are dangerous. These products contain only
1-10% of the harmful ingredient cresol, so if you don’t take a certain
amount, it won’t be fatal. The ingredients contain 40-70% of
orthodichlorobenzene. It is highly toxic, so the drug itself is quite
toxic. Cresol can cause mucosal corrosion, vasoconstriction, etc.
Orthodichlorobenzene can inhibit the central nervous system and
stimulate mucous membranes. Both cause harm to the liver and kidneys.
Taking it will cause upper digestive organ pain, sensory disturbance,
lowered blood pressure, circulatory insufficiency and death.</p>

<p>It is also possible to pour kerosene, gasoline, etc. on the body and
light it on fire, but if you take it, you can die without much pain in a
small amount. Both of these will irritate the mucous membranes and
inhibit the central nervous system after taking them. Nausea,
drowsiness, chest burning sensation, confusion, etc. may occur, and
eventually death may occur due to respiratory arrest. Sometimes there
are cases of sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation. However,
there have been cases of recovery after drinking 250ml of gasoline.</p>
<p>Benzene is readily available in pharmacies. The minimum lethal dose
is 10 ml, which is equivalent to one-fifth of a glass, but at least 100
ml should be taken. But this cannot be considered a large amount. After
taking it, the central nervous system is suppressed and the whole body
becomes anesthetized. The first symptoms are headache, dizziness, a
short-term feeling of intoxication and drowsiness, and death due to
respiratory failure or sudden ventricular fibrillation. The symptoms of
poisoning are not serious and are most suitable for suicide.</p>
<p>Inhaling the volatile components of benzene is more toxic than taking
it. However, since the lethal dose of inhalation has not yet been
determined, we will not introduce it. Thinner is originally a “liquid
for diluting paint” and is mostly a mixture of toluene and methyl
alcohol. Most of them are obtained by others, and the content of
ingredients is not fixed, so they are not suitable for planned suicide,
but they are very toxic. After taking it, there will be a burning
sensation in the mouth, esophagus, and stomach, which will inhibit the
central nervous system, damage the hematopoietic function, and lead to
death.</p>
<p>The use of thinner is easy to cause death by inhalation. 1-3ppm can
immediately cause anesthesia. Fill the washbasin with banana water and
cover it with a quilt, and you will lose consciousness and die from lack
of oxygen. This is the only peaceful method of suicide other than
medicine. High purity diluents should be used. Of course, taking a few
puffs to speed things up is a good place to start before resorting to
other methods of suicide.</p>

<p>Rust removers such as “Clean Rust” and “Best Clean” contain
approximately 40% concentration and 89% phosphoric acid. The lethal dose
of herbicide is 22.5ml. If such a large amount is taken, it is not so
much the toxicity of the phosphoric acid itself that causes tissue
damage in the mouth, esophagus, stomach, etc., leading to acute death.
Disinfectants are highly toxic and are readily available in pharmacies,
making them an excellent suicide drug. Apart from medicines, there is
probably nothing beyond it. A pharmacist also said: “This kind of thing
is the easiest way to kill. Because you can drink it in large
gulps.”</p>
<p>Iodine can corrode digestive organs, cause headaches, confusion and
shock, leading to drowsiness and death.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the lethal dose of cresol for an adult
weighing 60 kg is 180mg. Taking it can excite the central nervous system
and then show an anesthetic effect, leading to sensory impairment and
spasm, ranging from confusion, respiratory paralysis to cardiac arrest.
Loss of consciousness can occur within five minutes as quickly as
possible and as late as thirty minutes. It is harmful to the kidneys and
liver, and the 24 hours after ingestion are critical. A 14-year-old
junior high school student who fell into a coma after drinking about 80
mg of cresol regained consciousness for a time, but his liver and
kidneys were damaged. Six days later, he developed a pneumothorax in
which air was trapped in the lung membrane, and he died due to cardiac
arrest.</p>
<p>The most common ingredient in today’s car antifreeze is ethylene
glycol. It can be directly absorbed by the human body and metabolized
into a variety of substances in the human body, some of which are
neurotoxic or can disrupt the material circulation in the human body,
eventually causing people to die from systemic acidosis or multiple
organ failure. Car antifreeze containing ethylene glycol and even pure
ethylene glycol are easily available. Plus, pure ethylene glycol is
sweet, which is much better than the weird taste of other things. But if
you take ethylene glycol, you will die in pain.</p>

<p>Nail polish remover is the most dangerous product in cosmetics.
Containing 20%-25% of acetone and 30%-50% of amyl acetate, it has
anesthetic properties. Taking a large amount will irritate the mucous
membrane, causing headaches, excitement, fatigue, and even coma. The
content varies from product to product, so use this table as a reference
to confirm the lethal dose. If a suicide attempt fails, the liver and
kidneys may be damaged.</p>
<p>Nail lacquer also contains 30% acetone and 30% amyl acetate. Drinking
500-750mg can reach a fatal dose. There is severe nausea, but as long as
it is absorbed, there will be headache, excitement and coma. Since it is
not very toxic, the disadvantage is that it must be consumed in large
quantities.</p>
<p>Paraphenylenediamine, an ingredient in hair dye, is used to dye hair
black and is extremely toxic. “Higan Colorful Hair” (Houyuu), “Paon”,
“Veraton”, (Ero Cosmetics), etc. all contain about 2% of
paraphenylenediamine. The content of powder is higher. “Paon” powder (6g
in a box) contains 6%; only drinking 14g is enough. Of course, when
drinking, it is better to dissolve it in water first to improve its
absorption rate.</p>
<p>Taking large amounts can cause acute liver disorders ranging from
circulatory collapse to respiratory distress to death. The second liquid
neutralizer of perm solution contains 2%-6% potassium bromate (potassium
bromate). Potassium bromate stimulates the central nervous system and
gastric tissue, causing nausea, vomiting, stomach burning, and coma. It
sometimes causes hearing impairment and is considered highly toxic.
However, due to the small amount, at least 80 g is required to cause
death. To be sure, you must drink one kilogram of hair perming liquid.
So I’m not going to recommend it.</p>

<p>Although herbicides containing paraquat are not easily available to
ordinary people, they are still widely used in rural areas, so they can
still be obtained. This is a highly toxic drug and the antidote is still
unclear.</p>
<p>Paraquat and Diquat have similar structures and properties. Both of
them produce enzymes in the body and deteriorate the lipids of cell
membranes. Severe vomiting may occur after drinking, and the mouth,
esophagus, and digestive organs may rot, harming the liver, kidneys,
circulatory organs, lungs, etc., and may lead to death. The
characteristic is that although the internal organs are damaged, the
sensation is clear, so the pain is greater (Case study 3).</p>
<p>The herbicide “Gramochon” contains paraquat 24%, “Pragrocks L” and
“Majiate” contain 5% paraquat and 7% diquat, “Regorox” contains 30% of
diquat. The lethal dose of “Regorox” is 20-40ml. In addition, there are
many herbicides containing two ingredients.</p>
<p>In one case, a 40-year-old woman attempted suicide after drinking
about 10ml of paraquat. A 28-year-old man who drank approximately 100 ml
of the herbicide “Gramochon” died of lung disease 14 days later.
Similarly, a 50-year-old woman who drank 250 mg of Glamox died of
circulatory failure thirty hours later. A 67-year-old man who drank
about 100 mg of “Regorox” died of respiratory arrest six hours
later.</p>
<p>In short, if you want to die early, you must drink a lot.</p>

<p>A few years ago, the plant aconitum, which attracted attention
because it was used in murder cases and became a big seller, contains
aconitine, which is known to be highly toxic among plant poisons. The
roots contain particularly large amounts, which can irritate the body.
It damages the central nervous system, peripheral nerves, heart, etc.,
especially the marrow, causing paralysis of the respiratory muscles,
which can stop the respiratory function in about two hours. However,
what ordinary florists sell is the less toxic floral aconitum. There are
many species in the family of Aconitum. There’s one, <em>Aconitum
japonicum subsp. japonicum</em> (ヤマトリカブト) that mainly grows in
the mountain forests of Honshu, and can be harvested there. In fact,
some people mistakenly thought that it’s a wild herb, and ate it, and
was poisoned.</p>
<p>I would presume nobody wants to commit suicide by eating salt.
However, salt can also cause death. Because it is very interesting, I
will introduce it here. If you plan to commit suicide with salt, you
must drink 300 grams (a cup). Someone once died after drinking a liter
(about 1.8 liters) of soy sauce because the soy sauce contained about
14% salt. Symptoms of salt poisoning include dizziness, confusion,
shortness of breath, fever, weakness, etc. Ingestion of large amounts
salt can cause disorders in the circulatory system, liver, kidneys,
etc., which can lead to fatal injuries.</p>
<p>At this point, you may be wondering why the commonly heard names of
potassium cyanide and tetrodotoxin do not appear. This is because the
current regulations on management and disposal are extremely strict and
difficult to obtain, so even listing them is meaningless, so they are
not listed here.</p>
<p>The ovaries and liver of puffer fish are highly toxic, but due to
differences in the fish body and the season, the toxicity will vary to a
certain extent. Even if you get it, it may not be suitable for suicide.
Regarding these, drugs that are difficult to obtain and their lethal
doses are tabulated at the end of this chapter. If you can get it, I
hope you can use it as you see fit.</p>
<h2
id="case-study-3-a-boy-who-died-eight-days-after-drinking-paraquat">Case
study 3: A boy who died eight days after drinking paraquat</h2>
<p>In October 1985 in Gunma County, family members returning home from
an outing found a boy in the second grade of middle school (14 years old
at the time) wandering around in the room holding his stomach. That
morning he went out as usual, drank about 40 to 50 ml of the pesticide
paraquat in the forest away from school, and then returned home. In
addition to bicycles and schoolbags used for school, there were also
hastily written suicide notes, traces of vomiting, medicine bottles,
etc. left behind in the mountains and forests. When he was taken to the
hospital, his mouth and throat were ulcerated, and his mouth bled
whenever he screamed. After that, although it was quite painful, he
still said “I want to eat early”, “I want to read comics”, “Thank you,
Mom and Dad”, etc. After a while, he started to say some fantasy words,
“My bus has left”, “The UFO is coming” and so on. Sometimes he would
make such a loud noise that it would take four adults to subdue him, but
he would still die eight days later.</p>
<p>The suicide note contained the names of three students in the same
class and the words “I will always hate you even in heaven.”. He was a
member of the basketball team. About three months before his suicide, he
was often scolded by others during practice, saying: “What are you
doing!”, “Don’t be lazy!”, etc., and he was beaten and kicked in the
chest. and abdomen. After quitting in October, he was beaten behind the
gym after class. The reason for his suicide was the bullying from the
above.</p>
<p>He is a computer fanatic, reading books about computers, and also
likes cartoons. A large still of Rumiko Takahashi’s original work
“Urusei Yatsura”<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> hangs in his room.</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-2">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>Words such as “nausea”, “mucosal corrosion”, and “disorder” have been
used in the case report. In fact, these are the symptoms.</p>
<p>The lethal dose of paraquat is 15 mg. It is unknown what proportion
of paraquat the pesticide the teenager drank contained. In addition to
the immediate vomiting, the actual amount absorbed into the body
probably reached the lethal dose. Because he was an athlete and had
quite good physical strength, he lasted eight days. However, generally
speaking, suicide by taking poison means that there are many cases of
death in the hospital bed after several days.</p>
<p>This case is a boy who committed suicide due to being bullied. As he
belongs to a sport with strict training and team competition, it is
natural for a few guys to bully others. The exact level of violence
involved is unknown, but is common. In fact, it’s not just limited to
club activities, it’s what happens in the world.</p>

<p>The triple benefits of certainty, simplicity, and painlessness is
overwhelmingly loved by men, women, and children alike, and can be
called the “Monarch of Suicide”.</p>
<p>It may seem like I’m making an unfounded conclusion, but there is no
safer, more reliable, and easier way to commit suicide than hanging.
There is actually no need to consider any other method. You may not
believe it, but after careful investigation, I still haven’t found a
better method than hanging. The following will also describe in detail
why hanging is superior to other methods. It can even be said that
hanging is a work of art imagined by humans. Because of this, half of
the suicides in Japan every year choose this method, and it has been
widely used both at home and abroad in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of hanging is that the failure rate is
extremely low. As long as the rope is intact, the branches around the
rope are not broken, and the hanging is not discovered within ten
minutes after hanging, the success rate is basicaly 100%. There was a
person who took poison and then seppuku, but did not die, then he waited
for the train on the track but it didn’t come. Out of options, he went
to jump off a cliff, and did not die either. Finally, he successfully
hanged himself from a tree on the cliff.</p>
<p>“If you want to die, hang yourself.” People who are planning to
commit suicide should burn this into their minds.</p>
<h2 id="preparation-simply-a-rope">Preparation: Simply a rope</h2>
<p>All you need is a piece of rope. Wires, belts, ropes, anything that
can be wrapped around your neck. However, try to choose something that
is soft and can lie flat against your neck. Such as the plastic tape
used for packaging in department stores, etc., which is enough even for
a person weighing more than 100 kilograms. If something with cutting
force, such as a steel wire, is used, the head and neck may be severed.
Someone took a steel cable for pulling vehicles, tied one end to the
bridge railing, the other end around his neck, and then jumped into the
river. As a result, his head was sliced off and flowed down the river,
becoming an “unexplained mysterious death” and occupied the local
headlines for a while. There was also a very courageous company employee
who tied a vehicle-pulling cable to a tree, put the other end around his
neck, started the vehicle, and decapitated himself.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/2_1.png"
alt="Figure 1: The anatomy of strangulation (left) and hanging (right)." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 1: The anatomy of strangulation
(left) and hanging (right).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can tie the rope while you are sitting or even lying down, as
long as it is not a thin branch that is easy to break. There was a boy
in 7th grade who hanged himself by nailing a nail to the bookshelf.
However, it is often difficult to find a suitable place to put a rope,
especially in hospitals and detention centers. However, hanging does not
require that the rope be tied to a place higher than your body length.
Even if your feet or buttocks touch the floor, you can still die. There
are some people who hang themselves on hospital beds, and this is also
theoretically explainable.</p>
<p>Before explaining this theory, let’s talk about the differences
between the cause of death by strangulation and hanging. The former is
mostly caused by suffocation by blocking the trachea, while the latter
is mostly caused by the lack of oxygen in the brain by blocking blood
flow to the brain.</p>
<p>There are two types of arteries that supply blood to the brain: the
carotid artery and the vertebral artery, which is protected by bone next
to the spine. Even if the carotid artery is blocked by strangulation,
the vertebral artery protected by the bone cannot be blocked. However,
in the way of hanging, the neck is hung diagonally upward to form an
angle, so both arteries are blocked together, and the blood supply to
the brain stops instantly (see Figure 1).<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
The difference between the two can be seen from the corpse. Although the
blood supply from the vertebral arteries to the brain of the strangled
corpse continued, on the contrary, the carotid arteries that carried
blood from the brain were blocked, so they turned purple and had blood
stuck in the head; in the hanging method, there was no blood stuck in
the head. Now that we have clarified some basic issues, let’s return to
the issue of the height of hanging.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/2_2.png"
alt="Figure 2: Various positions in which people have died by hanging." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 2: Various positions in which
people have died by hanging.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When hanging, for a person whose blood pressure is 170 mmHg, it takes
3.5 kg of force to block the carotid artery and 16.6 kg of force to
block the vertebral artery. If your feet are on the ground and your
knees are bent, 70 to 90% of your body weight (20% of your body weight
when your knees are on the ground) is pressed against your neck. For
example, when a person weighing 60 kg hangs with his knees on the
ground, the force pressing on his neck is 12 kg, and the carotid artery
will naturally be blocked. At this time, the vertebral artery has not
yet reached the point of complete blockage, so a small amount of blood
flows to the brain, but this is only a matter of time, and it is several
times better than simple strangulation. Loss of consciousness may come
later, but nothing ends in a near miss. In other words, even if the
force pressing on the neck is only 20% of the body weight, as long as
the neck is at an angle, death can be easily achieved without completely
lifting the body.</p>
<p>In fact, there are examples of people with their buttocks and back on
the floor (refer to Figure 3). Some people say that as long as the
height is above 30 cm, you can die. Some people even say that in Europe
and the United States, more hanging suicides have their feet touching
the ground than not. If you plan to die in your room, there is no need
to give up because you feel the height is not enough. A door handle is
enough, and using the slope of the stairs is also a good idea.</p>
<p>Another thing that should be noted is that although it is necessary
to find a place where it is not easy to be discovered, it is not like
suicide by gas or drugs, which requires a place where it cannot be
discovered for several hours or days. It would be impossible to save you
if you are not discovered within ten minutes. More than 30 minutes and
it would be a complete success.</p>
<p>If you don’t want your relatives and friends to see your body, it’s
best to choose a place a little further away from your home and your
daily commute to work and school. When you are identified and your
parents know about it, you are already in the hospital or the police
station.</p>
<h2 id="experience-instant-loss-of-consciousness-no-pain">Experience:
Instant loss of consciousness, no pain</h2>
<p>How would you feel if you put a rope around your neck, kicked off the
footstool and hung in mid-air?</p>
<p>According to research by forensic scientists, it is common knowledge
in the medical community that once someone hangs himself, his
consciousness becomes hazy and his hands and feet cannot move even if he
wants to. Moreover, there is no pain at all during the process.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, an actor performed hanging in front of the audience. The
moment he said, “Squat down like this…” he lost consciousness and died
in front of the audience. A forensic scientist wanted to experience the
pain of hanging. He placed a footstool in a position where he could
stand on it at any time and asked his colleagues to be present. As soon
as his feet left the footstool, he suddenly lost consciousness.
Fortunately, he was saved by his colleagues. There are many examples of
similar experiences.</p>
<p>A suicide attempter who was rescued from hanging with a wire said:
“My head was buzzing and I didn’t know anything. I had no consciousness.
Though I couldn’t breathe and reasonably would have felt bad or painful,
I felt no such thing.”</p>
<p>It’s not just not painful, it’s can also be quite comfortable. For
example, the thrill of being thrown unconscious by a choke-hold in judo,
or the case of a boy who hanged himself while playing a choking game
with a towel in the bathroom.</p>
<p>At the same time, if you hang too hard all at once, the neck joints
will dislocate, immediately leading to cardiac arrest and respiratory
arrest.</p>
<p>When it comes to hanging, many people think of being strangled by the
throat and suffocating to death in pain. In fact, before you feel out of
breath, your brain is deprived of oxygen and you lose consciousness, so
there is no pain.</p>
<p>If you doubt this statement, you can put a rope around your neck and
hang yourself to see if you really would lose consciousness in an
instant. Maybe as soon as you put on the rope and put some weight on it,
you will stop the experiment immediately because you feel more nervous
and scared than you thought!</p>
<h2 id="heart-stops-in-about-ten-minutes">Heart stops in about ten
minutes</h2>
<p>Some scholars have further divided it into several stages and
conducted detailed research.</p>
<p>The first stage starts with a buzzing head and tinnitus. Then a flash
of light in front of eyes, head felt hot, ears ringing, and flashing
lights in eyes. At the same time, consciousness began to blur.</p>
<p>In the second stage after losing consciousness, convulsions occur
throughout the body. It is said that the hands make paddling movements
and the feet make walking movements, and then the muscles of both hands
and feet begin to cramp, and then the whole body straightens up and
cramps. But for this spasm, I now think it is a small tremor in the
whole body. This stage lasts from one minute to one and a half minutes.
What is puzzling is that men will have an erection and ejaculate at this
time.</p>
<p>In the third stage, it is already in a state of suspended animation,
with urine, feces and semen leaking, eyeballs protruding, and breathing
stopped. This takes about a minute, so it only takes three to three and
a half minutes to get to this point. The heart is still beating at this
stage and a life may be saved if found. The heart will beat for about
ten minutes. Once the heart stops beating, there is no hope of
rescue.</p>
<p>There was an American acrobat who imitated hanging in front of the
audience. His usual arrangement was to give a prearranged secret signal
to his assistant as soon as his consciousness began to blur. One day, he
unexpectedly lost consciousness and failed to give the signal in time.
He hung there for thirteen minutes and did not revive when he was sent
to the hospital.</p>
<p>This means that in just ten minutes, if no one detects it, your
suicide will be successful and painless. There is probably no more
suitable way to commit suicide than this!</p>
<h2 id="corpse-appearance-is-it-unclean">Corpse appearance: Is it
unclean?</h2>
<p>The disadvantage of hanging that people often mention is that the
corpse looks bad. Incontinence and ejaculation do occur. Some people say
that because the throat is strangled upward, the tongue will stick out,
the face will turn purple due to congestion, and the eyeballs will
protrude. However, there are not many horrific examples of this. The
eyeballs will not protrude until several days after death, and the
tongue will not stick out even if it touches the teeth. That is to say,
the condition of the corpse is usually not like this.</p>
<p>Judging from the photos of hanged corpses, most of them are just
hanging there, no different from when they were alive. As mentioned
before, because the blood supply to the head is quickly cut off, there
is generally no congestion on the face. Although it doesn’t look very
good, compared with the corpses that jumped from buildings or crashed
into cars, it can be said to look decent enough.</p>
<p>To prevent incontinence, go to the bathroom beforehand. If you don’t
want to ejaculate, masturbate first. To follow Emperor Hirohito who died
on 7 January 1989, a 87-year-old man committed suicide on the day of his
death. He hung himself in an orange grove with gauze in his mouth and a
mask. Such elaborate preparations… let’s leave it at that.</p>
<h2 id="note-strangulation-is-painful">Note: Strangulation is
painful</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, the advantage of hanging is that the vertebral
artery is blocked due to the posture of pulling the neck from above. Of
course, if you strangle your neck with your hands, this artery cannot be
blocked, so the blood supply to the brain cannot cause you to lose
consciousness all of a sudden. In the case of hanging, the person loses
consciousness in the first stage as mentioned above. In the case of
strangulation, the person experiences the first, second and third stages
while being conscious, and then finally loses consciousness. The result
is that the trachea is blocked and suffocates, and cramps are
experienced, which is accompanied by considerable pain. Even so, there
are many people who commit suicide by strangulating their necks and
suffocating themselves. I couldn’t help but express my sympathy to him,
why didn’t they spend some time to create a height of 30
centimeters!?</p>
<p>A 42-year-old university associate professor tightened his tie bit by
bit, and finally died of bleeding from his mouth.</p>
<p>A 43-year-old woman who participated in the Tokyo Olympics swimming
competition and lived a mundane housewife life since then, made full use
of her extraordinary lung capacity and suffocated to death by wrapping
multiple layers of tape on her mouth, nose, and neck.</p>
<p>A 49-year-old housewife who was imprisoned for killing her son died
of suffocation after stuffing enough toilet paper into her stomach and
nose in the detention center.</p>
<p>There is also a 46-year-old construction worker who committed suicide
due to bronchial occlusion after swallowing about 100 g (about a roll)
of toilet paper in the police custody room.</p>
<p>Of course, you can die using this method of suffocation, but it is
accompanied by considerable pain, and I am not willing to recommend
it.</p>
<p>Regarding hanging, it should also be mentioned that due to the
formation of a hypoxic state inside the brain and the destruction of
cells, serious neurological sequelae will be left after a failed
attempt. The characteristics of brain cells are different from other
cells. They cannot regenerate if they are destroyed.<a href="#fn18"

Therefore, it is necessary to make careful arrangements not to be
discovered.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-4-tragedy-of-attempted-hanging-frank-nagai">Case
study 4: Tragedy of attempted hanging – Frank Nagai</h2>
<p>In October 1985, singer Frank Nagai (フランク 永井) (53 years old at
the time) returned home from a performance at around 10 in the evening.
He drank a little beer with his wife and went to bed around 10:30. But
in the middle of the night, after walking out of the bedroom, he did not
come back for a long time. When his wife came out to search, she found
that he was hanging with four or five ties on the handrail of the spiral
staircase between the first and second floors. It was around 3 in the
morning. When the ambulance arrived, Nagai had no breathing or pulse and
fell unconscious. When he was sent to the hospital, his pupils were
dilated and he was in a state of “imminent brain death”. But after four
or five days, he miraculously regained consciousness. After a month, he
could speak a few words, and when he saw the title of the song “君恋し”,
he could still recognize the character “君”. Later, he could write
“Nagai” (永井) from his name. Later, he was hospitalized and discharged
several times. He is now able to do some walking and sing familiar songs
on karaoke, which shows further recovery. Despite this, he could not
recognize his wife and friends who came to visit him, and he was in a
state of Alzheimer’s disease. In 1989, he became a
<em>kinchisansha</em>, a legally incompetent person who was not allowed
to handle his own affairs<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>.</p>
<p>When he told his friend Tetsurou Tanba about this experience, he said
this: “I had difficulty breathing as soon as I hanged myself, and my
vision instantly turned red and then completely black. I saw my face
tilted in the air, and gradually I heard a strange sound. The sound
gradually grew louder and disappeared into the dark tunnel. I suddenly
rose up, floating through the walls and doors, and could see the
situation in the lower world. Suddenly I noticed that I was standing on
the ground and heard from the front garden a beautiful music, I also
heard the voices of my deceased friends and relatives, and I was driven
forward by the feeling of nostalgia and reunion. There, the Sanzu River
stood<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>, but an unknown force pulled me
back.”</p>
<p>Nagai attempted suicide because her former lover claimed that the
child she gave birth to was theirs, and he was distressed by the
demanded child support.</p>
<h3 id="check-this-example">Check: this example</h3>
<p>This is probably the only case of attempted hanging that is publicly
sensational. Even if the success rate of hanging is close to 100%, it
will not be successful if it is discovered quickly. Judging from the
absence of pulse in the above example, the patient may have been hanging
for more than ten minutes. However, some experts believe that “[Judging
from the current state of recovery,] the time when he was found was just
three to four minutes after hanging, and his feet and buttocks should
have been on the ground. However, even if his life is saved, the damaged
brain nerves will not regenerate.” The kind of sequelae it will leave is
shown by Nagai’s situation. The nerve cells in the brain begin to die
the moment blood no longer circulates. It is very scary. Failed hanging
is very scary!</p>
<p>According to his own account, he lost consciousness in an instant (at
the usual level), and his vision turns red and then black. The wonderful
experiences that follow can be called “near-death experiences”. It is
said that many people who are on the verge of death have experienced
them.</p>

study 5: Hanging at a height of 91 centimeters – Tsuneo Mori, Chairman
of the Central Committee of the New Party of the United Red Army<a
href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></h2>
<p>On January 1, 1973, Tsuneo Mori (森 恒夫) (28 years old at the time),
who was in the Tokyo Detention Center, hanged himself in a single cell.
He himself was a member of an armed revolutionary group formed in
January 1972. His “only-gunnism”<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> advocated that
revolution can only succeed by relying on guns. He conducted armed
training at the underground headquarters in the mountains of Gunma
Prefecture and was arrested in February 1972. He confessed that he had
killed twelve “Red Army soldiers” on the grounds that “the action was
not revolutionary”. In September, he was transferred to the Tokyo
Detention Center, awaiting trial. This incident of lynching and torture
of twelve people was more “madness in a closed group” than the
Asama-sansou hostage crisis<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>, and it shocked
Japanese society for a while. On January 1, 1973, Tsuneo Mori ate both
breakfast and lunch as usual. At 01:38 in the afternoon, the guard on
patrol saw him sitting on a tatami mat reading a book. But fourteen
minutes later, at 01:52, when the guard visited the single cell again,
he had already tied a knot with a 60-centimeter-long towel on the
91-centimeter-high iron railing, put his head in it, and hanged himself.
The doctor came and gave him cardiac resuscitation drug injections and
artificial respiration, but to no avail, and he died about an hour
later. It is said that he tied his legs with the clothes around him and
stretched them there, forming a “く” shape and hanging there. Some
people say that when he died, his shape seemed to be “about to sit
down”. The analysis of this suicide is that when he committed suicide,
he “kicked his tied feet into the air hard, so gravity added to the
towel and strangled his neck”. Although he was unconscious when he was
found, his veins were the same as in a living body, and no bleeding or
incontinence was found.</p>
<p>He left two suicide notes, the content of which is said to be an
admission of the error of only-gunnism. I also heard that he loved
reading the Bible a few months before his suicide and became very
interested in Christianity.</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-3">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>Did his buttock touch the ground?</p>
<p>He was a small man, with 163 cm and 54 kg. The towel he uses is 60
cm, which is also very short. He tied a knot around the railing and put
it around his neck so his neck rested tightly on the railing.
Coincidentally, his waist is very long, and the towel is tightened
around his neck, so his buttocks may not even touch the ground. That is
to say, it is impossible for a man weighing 54 kg to wake up after 14
minutes by hanging with his feet on the ground and his back against the
wall. This is strong evidence that hanging is easy and can stop
breathing in a short time. Having said that, after unremitting efforts
and hardships for the revolution, he finally gave up his long-held
belief and surrendered to God. However, he committed suicide without
being rescued. How pitiful it must be.</p>
<p>However, even though it happened twenty years ago, the Red Army
cadres believing that they could start a communist revolution is a far
crazier thing than their killing of twelve of their own members.</p>
<h2
id="case-study-6-woman-rescued-from-hanging-in-psychiatric-hospital">Case
study 6: Woman rescued from hanging in psychiatric hospital</h2>
<p>May 17, 1982, 4:45 pm. In a mental hospital, a woman who was
hospitalized fell into a state of excitement and shouted, “Kill me!” and
was sent to the protection room. Forty minutes later, at 5:25, she
climbed onto the window pane covered with several quilts and hung
herself with a towel. When she was discovered, her breathing and heart
had stopped. She was rescued and given artificial respiration and
cardiotonic drugs. Five minutes later, spontaneous respiration and a
weak pulse appeared. Despite this, she was unconscious for two whole
days, and finally responded to the stimulation on the third day. She
regained consciousness on the fourth day, could eat and drink fluids
after a week, started “self-recovery training” on the second week, and
was able to live in a group life with other patients after another two
weeks. However, her memory has declined, lost her former enthusiasm. She
always hid behind others, and became more dependent on her
caregiver.</p>
<p>This woman had been admitted to this hospital for 13 years after she
turned 26, and had been admitted to other psychiatric hospitals three
times before that. After being discharged from the hospital in 1979, she
went to work in a nearby general hospital. She gave up his job due to
friction with a male employee in the unit and lived with another man.
Soon she started not eating and shouted, “Kill me!” Two years later, she
was hospitalized again. The hanging occurred six months later. This was
her third suicide attempt.</p>
<p>She had worked in a towel factory for six years after graduating from
high school, got married at the age of 23, divorced the next year, gave
birth to a boy, but the child died soon after. Also, four of her five
sisters, including her, had had attempted suicide.</p>
<h3 id="check-this-example-1">Check: this example</h3>
<p>As the nurses said: “It is one of the few rare cases where the
patient was brought back to life due to rapid treatment by medical staff
upon discovery.”. It is also a rare case where death was not achieved
even though the heart had stopped for a while. From the unrecorded forty
minutes, subtract the time for stacking quilts, we see that it should be
about fifteen minutes after hanging when she was found, at which point
her heart probably had just stopped. Although it had forty minutes and
sufficient height, it failed to cause death. This is in sharp contrast
to the case of Tsuneo Mori. It is very difficult to commit suicide in a
hospital or prison cell because of surveillance. It is especially
difficult to commit suicide in a hospital because of its complete
first-aid facilities.</p>
<p>Judging from these attempted cases, perhaps you are thinking that
hanging is not that simple. But, after all, these are extremely rare
examples. Judging from the fact that more than 10,000 people die from
hanging every year, and the success rate is almost 100%, hanging is
still the top method of suicide.</p>
<p>But what was the rest of her life about? It was far beyond misfortune
or bad luck. From the outside, this looks like a “living hell”. Judging
from the sequelae left behind, it might have been better to not have
saved her.</p>
<h1 id="map_1">Map 1: Aokigahara, the Sea of ​​Trees</h1>
<p>If you are bored with your work and relationships and want to commit
suicide quietly without others knowing, I advise you to step into
Aokigahara, the Sea of ​​Trees without hesitation. There is no place like
Aokigahara where it is easy to enter, but difficult to be found. Your
whereabouts will be unknown and you will disappear from people’s memory
over time. However, to achieve this goal, we must study the method of
entering the sea of ​​trees. This map can be used as a reference.<a

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The number of suicides in the Aokigahara is “about 30 per year, with
no increase or decrease” (Fujiyoshida Police Station). Most of the other
“suicide spots” have become a thing of the past, but the Sea of ​​Trees is
superior to other places as a suicide spot, as has been shown above.
Aokigahara was originally a local suicide spot, but it suddenly became
nationally famous and dozens of people committed suicide here every
year. The main reason was the TV series based on the <em>Tower of
Waves</em> (波の塔, Nami no Tou, 1960), with the Aokigahara as the
setting.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="place-where-the-body-cannot-be-found">Place where the body
cannot be found</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, once you enter the sea of ​​trees, you will
immediately lose your sense of direction and be unable to get out, so
you can walk in no matter where you are, but here we will introduce a
route where your body will never be found.</p>
<p>The most common way is to enter near the “Wind Cave”. Get off the
Fuji Express Bus at Wind Cave Station (see the traffic sign for
directions) and you will see the entrance to Wind Cave on the south side
of National Route 139. Walk forward to the ticket office of Wind Cave.
But don’t walk into the Wind Cave. There are two roads in front of the
ticket office. Take the Aokigahara Nature Trail on the left.</p>
<p>Go forward about 300 meters, and there is a fork in the road. You
have to go to the island on the left with “Ice Cave and Autumn Leaves
Terrace” (冰穴·红叶台) written on it. There is a sign on the front that
says “You only live once, cherish it”, but don’t take it seriously.</p>
<p>About 300 meters further on, there is a road sign with the words “Red
Leaves Terrace Ice Cave” (红叶台·冰穴) written on the left and “Mountain
Road” (山道) written on the right. There is another lead sheet lying on
the side of the mountain road. It says, “Life is a precious gift given
by parents! Think about parents, brothers and children again!” Ignore
it. You will inevitably feel a little shaken when you get here. You can
decide whether to go back because the compass still works. If you go
further, you will enter the Fugaku Forest Road.</p>
<p>This mountain road is a very ordinary mountain road, nothing special
for people with mountaineering experience. However, there are dense
forests all around, and since the scenery never changes, you gradually
start to wonder how far you have walked and where you have walked
into.</p>
<p>The mountain road generally extends southward. After walking for
about fifteen minutes, the road no longer looks like a road, and the
surrounding trees look a bit like primeval forest. At this time, we walk
forward for another fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>From now on, you can walk off the road into the dense forest from any
direction, but it is best to go to the right.</p>
<h2 id="a-place-where-the-body-will-never-be-found">A place where the
body will never be found</h2>
<p>In addition, we will introduce two places where you will never be
found.</p>
<p>One is to get off at the Fuji Express Bus “Red Leaf Terrace Entrance”
(红叶台入口). There is a fire brigade and the hotel “Rare Wood Museum”
(珍木馆) nearby. Walking along the asphalt road for about one kilometer,
you will gradually see a dense forest, and walking about one kilometer
further will be the virgin forest. Follow this road into the fork on the
left and go as deep as possible. Then just keep going forward. In this
area, not to mention the locals, even suicide-watch volunteers are
unlikely to come. Locals say this crossroad is “the most difficult area
to find bodies in”.</p>
<p>The other option is to get off the Fuji Express Bus “Akaike” (赤池)
and follow the asphalt road to the Shojin Lake Hiking Trail
(精进湖登山道). After walking for one to two kilometers, turn right and
enter the fork. Here, neither locals nor tourists will find corpses.</p>
<p>Both of these methods require a long walk, but the reliability of not
finding the corpse is relatively high when entering from the Wind Cave.
Since ordinary tourists don’t come here, don’t arouse people’s suspicion
when you walk in.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-go-another-hundred-meters-you-cant-turn-back">If you go
another hundred meters, you can’t turn back</h2>
<p>In the primeval forest, there are tangled tree roots everywhere, and
moss and fallen leaves cover the holes, so it is impossible to move
forward in a straight line. I thought I remembered the way I came from,
but after walking more than a hundred meters, I still couldn’t figure
out the direction at all. If you have a compass, throw it away. You
can’t go back to the same place anyway.</p>
<p>The most suitable method in a sea of ​​trees is to hang yourself, as
its lethality is high. Just bring a rope. However, the trees here are
all very tall, and it is quite difficult to find a suitable tree. In
order to find such a tree, you will have to wander further away from the
mountain road and be harder to be found. This way, you would disappear
from people’s memory even more forever than forever.</p>
<h2 id="note-2">Note</h2>
<h3 id="many-bodies-are-discovered-during-a-large-scale-search">Many
bodies are discovered during a large-scale search</h3>
<p>Every October, more than 600 people, including the local fire brigade
and police, conduct a large-scale search for corpses on Route Z in
Figure 1. In other words, if you commit suicide in the middle of the
national highway and the road on the south side of West Lake, your body
will still be found. Even if you are on either side of the national
highway and walk no more than 500 meters along the nature trail, it is
the same. The major searches in recent years have found three corpses in
1989 (one of which was female), none in 1990, five in 1991 (two of which
were female), and 1992. No search was conducted due to a homicide near
Wind Cave. In short, never enter this area. By the way, when a family
member requests a search, the search fee per person per day is 10,000
yen. In other words, if 50 people were mobilized to search for 2 days,
it would cost one million yen.</p>
<h3 id="beware-of-the-self-defense-forces">Beware of the Self-Defense
Forces</h3>
<p>Every March, from near the entrance of Wind Cave to Kentoku Dojo
(乾徳道場)<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>, the Self-Defense Forces conduct a
column walking training in the dense forest. It is said that most of the
bodies that were not found during the great search were discovered at
this time. Therefore, it is also better not to choose the area from the
south of the cave to the dojo. ### Don’t be suspected by the locals</p>
<p>People who have lived in the area for a long time can identify
suiciders at a glance. It is believed that simply carrying a small bag,
or not taking photos, is a telling sign, but more importantly they rely
on intuition. When you walk into the sea of ​​trees, the locals will greet
you and say, “Do you know where this place is?” and try to persuade you
to live. Even if you say, “Let me die,” they won’t listen. After more
than 40 minutes of gossiping, some would-be suiciders finally gave in
and turned back to the world of living. So, don’t take on the aura of
suicide in the first place. However, pretending to be happy at the
moment of death is a bit pointless. Don’t hesitate before entering the
sea of ​​trees. Walk in gracefully and the locals will not follow you in
suspicion. Because even if the locals walk a hundred meters into the
forest, it is difficult for them to come back.</p>
<h3 id="dont-underestimate-the-monk">Don’t underestimate the monk</h3>
<p>I heard that there is a mysterious monk living in Kentoku Dojo. The
house is ordinary, but he is often seen driving his car to go shopping
in places off mountain roads, but even the locals don’t know how he
makes a living. Since his existence cannot be underestimated, avoid
walking near this place.</p>
<h2 id="transportation-and-accommodation">Transportation and
accommodation</h2>
<p>It takes two hours by Fuji Bus from Mishima Station on the JR Line to
Fujiyoshida. Then transfer to the Fuji Bus to get to the Momijidai
entrance and Feng Cave which takes 30 to 40 minutes. Buses run every
hour. Please note that the bus frequency will be reduced in winter.</p>
<p>Of course, accommodation is not necessary, but I will introduce it
just for backup. There are many B&amp;Bs (bed-and-breakfast) in the
south of West Lake, which are open all year round. It is the most
convenient place to use them. From here, it takes about an hour by Fuji
Rapid Bus to get to Fuugano Station. You can stay at the Rare Wood
Museum at the entrance of the mountain trail.</p>
<h2
id="case-study-7-a-man-living-a-wandering-life-in-a-sea-of-trees">Case
study 7: A man living a wandering life in a sea of ​​trees</h2>
<p>There was a 21-year-old male company employee who was protected by
the police after wandering in a sea of ​​trees for 16 days in November
1983.</p>
<p>He drove away from his home in Yokohama in late September due to
business and personal worries. After driving around his hometown of
Aichi Prefecture and the Tohoku region for more than a month, he decided
to commit suicide. He sent a suicide note to his family and entered the
sea of ​​trees from the maple terrace in Narusawa Village (鸣泽村) on
October 26.</p>
<p>In the first week, he searched around for a suitable place to commit
suicide. Sometimes when he was about to hang myself, he met someone
picking mushrooms. When he couldn’t die at once, his desire to die
gradually became less and less. So, sometimes he went to the national
highway to buy some bread, sometimes he ate at the parking lot, and then
he returned to the sea of ​​trees. he lived like a vagabond. In the end,
he couldn’t resist the cold heavy rain, and he moved to the West Lake on
November 10th, went to a B&amp;B, and called home.</p>

<p>Jumping off suddenly is painless. It is highly lethal and is the most
high-modern method of suicide. It is not painful to suicide by jumping
off a building or a cliff.</p>
<p>There is no pain, no discomfort, and even no terror. Not only that,
it can even be very enjoyable. This is not a metaphor, it is actually
true. It sounds a bit nonsense, but if you put together the words of
those people who have jumped, it can only be said to be this way. This
point will be described in detail below, but in this way, suicide by
jumping off a building or a cliff can be said to be an excellent method
comparable to suicide by hanging. Jumping from buildings and cliffs does
not have the shadow that comes with other means of suicide.</p>
<p>The person who completely changed the concept of suicide by jumping
off a building and a cliff was a girl named Sato Kayo. In 1903, a young
man, Misao Fujimura, jumped from Kegon Falls, wrote in his celebrated
suicide note: “The true nature of the whole creation. Is in one word –
‘unfathomable’.”. It gives suicide a noble image of philosophy,
different from the past. Just like the successors who continue to
appear, Satō Kayo also gave falling suicide a certain sacred image,
attracting followers one after another, and even the myth “she fell, she
jumped” appeared. Satō Kayo is the real name of popular singer Yukiko
Okada.</p>
<p>Perhaps for this reason, regardless of age or sex, jumping off a
building or a cliff is second only to hanging. Young people and girls
are particularly fond of this method, and women are more likely to do
so. This method is on the rise, and now 50% of female suicides,
including teenage girls, commit suicide by falling, far ahead of other
suicide methods.</p>
<p>The earliest person to jump from a building is said to be a male
employee of a company who jumped from the seventh floor roof of Ginza
Matsusakaya Department Store to Ginza Street in 1935. The shift from
Kegon Falls or Kinpo in the past to high-rise buildings represented by
Takashimadaira community is closely related to urbanization and is also
one of the phenomena of urban modernization. The day after Okada Yukiko
committed suicide, that is, April 11, 1986, the 18-year-old girl took
her sister’s hand and left her to leave the community “in order to
understand her superpowers in her previous life.” jumped to his death
from the rooftop.</p>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<h3 id="requires-a-height-of-20-meters-above-the-ground58">Requires a
height of 20 meters above the ground<sup>58</sup></h3>
<p>When jumping from a tall building, you should check the necessary
height and the conditions of the landing site beforehand. There are many
suicide attempts, mostly because they fail to maintain the necessary
height. If you really want to die, you should jump from a height of more
than 20 meters from the ground, that is, from about seven to eight
floors above. If the ground is concrete, it cannot be saved. Jumping
from the fourth floor, the success rate is only about 50%. Incidentally,
each additional floor is three meters higher, which may be used as a
basis for conversion.</p>
<p>It is also very important to check the landing place. There is no
small bush downstairs. A 16-year-old girl who jumped from the roof of a
five-story school building about 18 meters high into the trees below
suffered only serious injuries. In the United States, a person fell from
a height of 28 meters into a flower bed and suffered only minor injuries
such as a broken rib and a fractured left wrist.</p>
<p>Make sure there are no trees or street lights downstairs either. A
17-year-old high school girl who jumped from a 35-meter-high fire escape
on the 14th floor only suffered serious injuries and was hospitalized
for six months. As a result, she attempted suicide, but there was a
green space downstairs. When she fell, the windbreaker she wore outside
her uniform inflated with the air and acted like a parachute. She hit a
maple tree in mid-air, thus avoiding death. A reporter from a news
agency jumped from the seventh floor of a business hotel in Shinjuku. He
hit a streetlight in mid-air and landed feet first. His left shoulder
and pelvis were fractured but he did not die. He did not lose
consciousness at the time, muttering “fuck, fuck” to himself while
answering questions from the police who arrived.</p>
<p>Vehicles sometimes also act as pads. In Nagoya City, a 40-year-old
man jumped onto the road from the roof of a 33-meter-high department
store and fell onto the hood of a vehicle in a prone position. He
suffered facial contusions and a fractured right shoulder for three
months.</p>
<p>Also, a zinc roof with bike parking underneath would not work.
Because she was forbidden to keep at home a stray kitten she picked up,
a 14-year-old girl jumped from the 11th floor with the kitten in her
arms, breaking a large piece of the zinc roof of the bicycle parking
area and breaking three ribs. She was seriously injured, but both she
and the kitten survived.</p>
<p>Although this is a special example, note that, in an airplane
accident in the United States, someone fell from a height of 370 meters
to a patch of snow. He survived with just waist and a few ribs broken.
Therefore, attention should also be paid to snow accumulation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>58</sup> Generally speaking, the mortality rate of a 10m high
fall is about 80%, and the mortality rate of a 12m high fall is close to
90%.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="look-for-an-inconspicuous-place">Look for an inconspicuous
place</h3>
<p>In order not to be quickly discovered and sent to the hospital,
finding an inconspicuous place is also the first consideration. The
college girl who jumped from the middle of the Marunouchi Building and
the adjacent building was discovered a year later. It was quite an
inconspicuous place, since she was not discovered until such a long time
later. Next to the stone wall under Building No. 7 of Sophia University,
when collecting the bodies of students who jumped from the roof, they
accidentally found the bodies of students who had disappeared six months
ago. Of course, such cases are rare.</p>
<h2 id="experience-a-painless-way-to-die">Experience: A painless way to
die</h2>
<p>The most curious thing is what it feels like during the falling
process and whether there is pain when landing.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old man who jumped from the fourth floor of the building
and was saved said: “I didn’t feel afraid. I naturally jumped over the
balcony railing with my whole body. I can’t remember whether I felt pain
when I fell to the ground, but I knew it.” He still fell to the ground.”
Regarding the feeling of continuing to fall in mid-air, he said: “In the
process of jumping to the ground, although it is a natural thing, I
still think about whether the head or the feet landed first. The problem
was probably because he didn’t want his face to touch the ground, so he
naturally covered his face with his hands.”</p>
<p>A man who survived a fall from a height onto the glacier bank said:
“It was as if I was sitting on huge wings and slowly descending. I
thought calmly of myself and my family’s future, and many memories
passed by like lightning. My mind. After falling to the ground, my
breathing was not disordered, and I lost consciousness without any pain.
Although my head, hands, and feet collided with rocks or ice and were
injured in many places, I didn’t feel anything. It can be said that,
there is no time more joyful than this moment!”</p>
<p>There are countless examples of such falls due to accidents. What
these experiences have in common is that they start to fall slowly and
have very clear perception. There is no uneasiness or fear at all. It is
almost like a dream. At this time, childhood memories often roll through
the mind like a revolving lantern. Sometimes one sees mysterious lights,
and sometimes one has an out-of-body experience and watches down at
one’s falling self. And when one finally lands on the ground, one loses
consciousness in a peaceful mood.</p>
<p>Most people who commit suicide by jumping off buildings or cliffs do
not scream or shout loudly, probably for this reason. A person who fell
said: “I really want to emphasize that falling from a height is the most
painless way to die.” Another person who fell even said: “It was a
perfect death, there was no pain at all, and it was much more painful
than an injection.” Therefore, it can be said that there is no pain in
committing suicide by jumping off a building or a cliff. Of course,
there are exceptions.</p>

crying “It hurts! It hurts!”</h2>

<p>“I’m going to commit suicide now, bye-bye!” The female high school
student who was sitting on the window sill on the fourth floor of the
school suddenly jumped down. When she was picked up, she whispered, “It
hurts so much, it hurts so much!” and cried. She broke her head and neck
and died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The reason is of course
very clear, because the fourth floor is not high enough. In order not to
leave any feeling of pain, you should choose a height where you can die
on the spot or at least pass out.</p>
<p>Also, a 30-year-old woman jumped from the 35th floor of the Shinjuku
Sumitomo Building, 140 meters above the ground. She stretched her hands
horizontally and fell in a high-altitude diving position. Half of her
face His head was smashed into pieces and he died on the spot. At this
time, the witness heard a scream of “Waaa–”. There was also a
17-year-old female high school student who jumped from the 11th floor
while screaming. It is unknown whether they felt terrified when they
jumped off the building.</p>
<p>By physics, when you jump from a height of 20 meters (about seven
stories), your terminal velocity is 20 m/s, or 70 km/h. Falling takes 2
seconds. In just 2 seconds, you will rotate into various postures and
land at a speed of about 70 km/h. Imagine that when riding a motorcycle
or riding a car, hitting a wall at this speed is not as big of a
collision as you might imagine. However, if you fall from a higher
place, the impact when you land is huge. In one unbelievable case, a
female high school student jumped from the roof of an eleventh-floor
apartment, and when she landed, she broke an iron sewer cover in half.<a

<h2 id="cliff-jumping">Cliff jumping</h2>
<p>When jumping off a cliff, various situations may occur due to the
surrounding natural environment. Although it is a bit uncertain, most
deaths result from violent collisions, not drowning. There are many
cases of people dying due to collision with rocks while falling into the
sea or waterfall. Comedian Haruo Nakata committed suicide in Kinpo,
Atami. His internal organs ruptured and he died after falling and
hitting a cliff. The 53-year-old man who also jumped in Nishikigaura in
Atami, Shizuoka, and suffered contusions all over his body and died on
the spot. Of course, if you fall into the sea or lake, you may
drown.</p>

<p>Cliff jumping can sometimes be unreliable. Two female junior high
school students committed suicide by jumping off a 60-meter-high cliff.
One died, but the other was saved. Jumping off a cliff under the same
conditions, the outcome is actually very different. Furthermore, no
matter how steep the cliff is, you will not necessarily die if you fall
into the sea. So, in this case, choose famous places. Scenic spots have
their origins, that’s why they become famous places. If you choose
cliffs, you can choose from Cape Ashizuri in Shikoku or Nishikigaura in
Atami, Shizuoka, or waterfalls such as Kegon Falls.</p>
<h2 id="corpse-appearance-injuries-everywhere-but-not-grotesque">Corpse
appearance: injuries everywhere, but not grotesque</h2>
<p>As the 54-year-old man thought after jumping, which part of the body
would hit the ground first?</p>
<p>According to a study by a medical expert, when people commit suicide
by jumping off a building, they are most likely to land feet first. When
landing feet first, 60% of people suffered head injuries, 30% suffered
spinal fractures, 20% suffered liver and lung damage, and 25% suffered
heart damage.</p>
<p>The second is falling headfirst to the ground. With that, skull
fractures, brain injuries, and rib fractures occur. Fractures of arms,
spine, and lung injuries are more common. The next common is landing on
the buttocks, and the next is landing on the side.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter which part hits the ground first, multiple body
parts will be injured. Judging from those who committed suicide by
jumping from buildings and cliffs, nearly 70% of the cases were injured
in more than three places, including the head, abdomen, hands and feet.
In short, injuries can occur anywhere in the body, but injuries to the
head and chest are the most common, accounting for more than 70% of
fatal injuries. The heart suffers sudden deceleration and the aorta is
often ruptured. As a result, one may died from skull fractures, body
contusions, visceral rupture, excessive bleeding, or other causes.</p>
<p>There may be corpses that are so miserable that they don’t want
others to see them, but once they are discovered, ambulances arrive
quickly and the corpses are taken away in the blink of an eye. Judging
from the condition of the buttocks on the ground, sometimes there are
almost no signs of injury on the body (Case study 9).<a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>
Therefore, committing suicide by jumping off a building is not such an
ugly way to die.</p>
<h2 id="note-3">Note</h2>
<h3 id="watch-out-for-pedestrians">Watch out for pedestrians</h3>
<p>If there are people in the landing place, it will cause many
problems.</p>
<p>There are several examples of people surviving because they fell on
pedestrians, but the injured people who were crushed under them will
claim huge compensation for their injuries. A high school student from a
communication school in Saitama Prefecture jumped from the roof of a
department store and landed on a car parked below. Although he died, the
man sitting in the car also broke his neck bones and became paralyzed
from the chest down. The family of the deceased must pay a compensation
of 200 million yen.</p>
<p>A recent example is that in November 1992, a man jumped from the
eighth floor of an apartment and landed on a senior high school student
who was talking to his girlfriend below. The jumper died soon after, and
the student died four days later. It is never a good thing to jump off a
building and fall on someone else, so please be aware of this.</p>
<p>A 51-year-old company director wanted to jump from the top floor of
an apartment building, but he saw several children playing below, so he
grabbed the railing of the corridor on the fourteenth floor with his
hands behind his back and shouted, “Get away! Get away!” “After the
children dispersed, he jumped down and successfully achieved his goal.
Since it was 14 stories high, the shouting should have been quite loud.
If you don’t want to cause trouble to your family, please pay special
attention.</p>
<h3 id="head-side-down">Head-side down</h3>
<p>Even if you fall from up high, you may survive. Even if you fall from
down low, you may die. Some fell from a height of 6 meters to the bottom
of the river and died from their skulls. Others fell from a 6-meter-high
pedestrian bridge onto the road and broke their heads, and died an hour
and a half later. If you don’t want to fail, you should land with your
head on the ground. If you fall skillfully, you will die on the spot
even from a height of 5 meters. Also, although the damage to the place
of landing may not kill you, death may occur due to special reasons. A
50-year-old woman fell from the fourth-floor balcony of an apartment and
broke her waist in many places, but she died of systemic contusion. A
man jumped from the third floor of his dormitory and died of pulmonary
congestion and acute pulmonary embolism 20 days later.</p>
<h2
id="case-study-8-a-college-student-who-jumped-from-the-15th-floor.-how-he-felt-during-the-jump.">Case
study 8: A college student who jumped from the 15th floor. How he felt
during the jump.</h2>
<p>In October 1986, a 21-year-old junior college student jumped from the
top floor of a 15th-floor apartment in Urawa City, Saitama Prefecture.
With a “pop” sound, he fell to the iron roof of the bicycle shed. He was
immediately taken to the hospital but had no other injuries other than a
minor injury to his left foot. The roof of the bicycle shed where he
fell left a large hole in the shape of a large font.</p>
<p>This man described the feeling of being in mid-air very calmly: “As I
fell, I felt my shoes and glasses slowly falling off. After falling to
the ceiling for a while, I suddenly thought, ah! I am still alive.” He I
was left with a language barrier like stuttering, and he was worried
that he might not be able to pass the job interview the next year.</p>
<h3 id="check-this-example-3">Check: this example</h3>
<p>This is the “state of mind in the air” mentioned by suicide
attempters who jumped from high places. There are very few cases of
survivors. The 15th floor is about 40 meters high. Jumping from this
height will feel like you are descending slowly, and you may be very
calm. There is no sense of terror or pain when you land. It’s a miracle
that he fell from the 15th floor and barely got hurt. Therefore, those
who are determined to commit suicide by jumping off a building should
also avoid bicycle sheds.</p>
<p>There was a loud “pop” sound when he fell to the ground. So, what
kind of sound would a suicide make when he fell? You might as well check
it out.</p>
<p>Of course, this depends on what kind of place one fell from. If the
ground was concrete, the female high school student who fell from the
roof of the 15th floor apartment made a “pop” sound. The man who fell
from the 4th floor apartment window made a “sound like a deflating
balloon.” The aforementioned woman who jumped from the Shinjuku Sumitomo
Building made a “pop” sound. If one falls on someone else, it will make
a “sound like a ball hitting the ground and bouncing” just like the
Yokohama high school student mentioned above when he fell. When Yukiko
Okada fell from the roof of a 20-meter-high building, she was said to
have made a loud “thud” sound, possibly because her skull hit the
concrete floor violently.</p>

id="case-study-9-living-is-boring-anyway-cartoonist-hanako-yamada">Case
study 9: “Living is boring anyway” cartoonist Hanako Yamada</h2>
<p>On May 24, 1992, manga artist Hanako Yamada<a href="#fn30"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>
(24 years old at the time) committed suicide by jumping from the
eleventh floor of an apartment near her home in Tama City, Tokyo.
Because the waist was on the ground, the body was relatively complete
and there was very little bleeding. Even his parents were surprised, “Is
he really dead?”</p>
<p>She was introverted when she was in elementary school and loved to
stay at home. When she was in the second grade of middle school, she
tried to commit suicide by using gas because she was bullied. In high
school, I was bullied repeatedly and dropped out after one year. Later,
he became a cartoonist and had his works serialized in “Weekly Young
Jump”, but the painting circles did not give him favorable reviews.
Soon, the serialized work could not be published, and was finally
published in the underground comic magazine “Garo”<a href="#fn31"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>,
which did not pay royalties. Unable to make a living by comics alone,
she worked as a waiter in a teahouse. However, she couldn’t remember the
customers’ orders if the orders get long, and because she was not
efficient enough in her work, she was fired one after another and was
bullied in the workplace. The restaurant where she had been working for
half a year finally gave up. After suffering this series of blows, she
became mentally disturbed. She went to this restaurant that was open
late at night and begged “Hire me again!” and forced herself to go to
work every night. Unable to bear it, the store owner called the police
half a month later, and her parents took her back. In the taxi on the
way home, she seemed to be crying when she said, “Everyone bullied me.”
In fact, she was laughing. She suffered from schizophrenia. Soon she
entered a psychiatric hospital and was discharged two months later.
However, she lost confidence in her future. On the day after she was
discharged, she fell from an apartment near her home and died.</p>
<p>She wrote in her diary two days before committing suicide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can’t get along with others. I have a weird personality and I don’t
have any friends. … I can’t see the future, and I can’t find a job.
(Being bullied) … Nothing. I don’t want to do it anymore. Everything is
so strenuous, I have no strength, and I’m very tired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was probably the suicide note she meant to leave behind.</p>
<h3 id="corpse-appearance">Corpse appearance</h3>
<p>The body of a person who committed suicide by jumping off a building
is horrific to look at, especially when the head falls to the ground.
Like the previous example where the waist is on the ground, the face
will be intact. However, the leg may have been twisted due to fracture
when it hit the ground first, which is really unsightly.</p>

</figure>
<p>What we should pay attention to here is the “bullying” that Yamada
Hanako suffered everywhere. No matter where she goes, the “guys” who are
bullied will always be bullied, and she herself proves this fact. Also,
most of the “diary comics” she drew show her paying special attention to
“how others see her” at school or in the workplace. It can also be seen
from this that she was born with a symptom called “horror of the gaze”.
She herself said that she has a “horror of people”, just like she must
wear sunglasses when going out. Her life is spent in the never-ending
fear of other people’s eyes. Coupled with being bullied again, he
finally suffered from schizophrenia and committed suicide. Who could
have imagined the extent of her troubles? Those who are unhappy,
introverted, and unable to handle affairs neatly are not suitable to
survive in a society like Japan. Henry Morselli, an Italian suicide
researcher in the 19th century said: “Suicide is a means of naturally
eliminating those who are physically and mentally weak in the
competition for survival in nature.”<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> It is indeed true.
Hanako Yamada is also in peace, as one that was “eliminated from
competition”.</p>
<p>Her views on suicide during her lifetime are also worth mentioning.
In her comics, she quoted these lines from the movie <em>Phantom of the
Paradise</em> - “If you have no merit and are annoying, then go to hell!
Don’t say those bad words/There is no future in life/It’s better to make
a show of it than to mess around/ Living is boring anyway.”<a
href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition, she wrote in other magazines - “This world is inherently
cruel.” “Disabled people, laugh! Shout! Curse your fate! This is what
your life is like. If you feel disgusted, commit suicide.” Her heartfelt
words about the helpless misfortune can only be spoken by someone who
has lived through the misfortune. There are indeed insurmountable
misfortunes in this world. She made this fact clear in one sentence,
which is consistent with the purpose of this book.</p>

study 10: A middle school student who committed suicide by jumping off a
building because of bullying</h2>
<p>On September 9, 1979, in the courtyard of an apartment in Fukuoka
City, Saitama Prefecture, a first-year junior high school student (12
years old at the time) was found dead wearing a karate suit and falling
into a “大” shape. At about 8 a.m. that day, he jumped from the tenth
floor of an apartment about two kilometers away from his home to the
concrete floor 20 meters below.</p>
<p>The reason for committing suicide was bullying. This student, who was
quite cheerful when he was in elementary school, got into fights over
trivial matters soon after entering middle school. With a height of only
142 cm, he was the shortest in the class. His classmates said that
“although he is small, he is quite arrogant” and was ostracized. There
was no one to talk to, so he remained silent every day, and as a result,
he was nicknamed “The Wall”. People often mock me and say, “You are the
wall, so go face the wall.”</p>
<p>On the evening of June 18th of the same year, the boy posted his
suicide note on his desk and disappeared. The suicide note read, “I am
bullied every day. I don’t want to go to school. I don’t want to live
anymore. I want to commit suicide.” However, at around 8 o’clock that
night, the boy returned home covered in sweat. Later, it’s said that he
wanted to jump from the top floor of the apartment, but he felt scared
and ran back. He was sweating profusely because he ran too fast.</p>
<p>News of the suicide attempt leaked out, and the bullies in the class
became even more aggressive. He has a new nickname “Suicide Boy”, and
his father used to be a cleaning truck driver. He was ridiculed as “very
dirty”, “very smelly” and “like a beggar”. Sometimes he was treated as a
thief and had mayonnaise smeared all over his face.</p>
<p>He couldn’t stand the bullying and missed school for the first time
the day before his suicide. The next day, which was Sunday, he committed
suicide. He wore a karate suit that day. He wore it when he started
practicing karate after his suicide attempt. This was also the first day
he wore it.</p>
<p>The naughty children who knew he had committed suicide actually
shouted “banzai”. As for the reason for their bullying, they said they
were “bored” and it’s “fun”.</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-4">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>The first time the teenager attempted suicide, he was so scared that
he ran home. Generally speaking, people who decide to commit suicide are
calm and not afraid even when they stand at a high place, but this is
not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>A 24-year-old woman wanted to commit suicide and climbed a mountain
with an altitude of 1,713 meters. However, when she approached the cliff
at the top of the mountain, she became frightened and did not dare to
jump. She was unable to get down. She spent three days and three nights
without food in the wind and rain. He lay there drinking and waiting for
help. This happened at the end of August. The temperature dropped to 6
to 7 degrees at night, and she was only wearing a blouse. It seemed that
it might be more comfortable to decide to die at that time.</p>
<h3
id="those-who-are-bullied-are-always-bullied-no-matter-what-they-do">Those
who are bullied are always bullied no matter what they do</h3>
<p>The same is true in the case of Yamada Hanako. It can only be said
that there is no way to not be bullied. The bullied boy will always get
bullied no matter what he does. Whether it was karate or suicide
attempts, they not only had no effect but actually worsened the
situation. In a class where there is no common goal but only
relationships between people, the only things that can be done are
pretend-loves and bullying.</p>
<p>It is said that his father once advised his son, who was in the first
grade of middle school, saying: “There are still two and a half years
left, just be patient.” However, no one can guarantee that he will be
happy after graduating from middle school, and changes will not
necessarily occur after entering high school. And considering that he
has to endure it for another two and a half years, the choice he made
can be said to be the right one. It would have been better to fall to
his death the first time he climbed up to the apartment. It is also
important to commit suicide early.</p>

<p>What does the Takashimadaira housing complex<a href="#fn34"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>
look like now? In fact, in response to the trend of people jumping off
buildings around 1980, all 37 high-rise buildings with more than 11
floors were equipped with exterior corridors and exterior stairs
starting from the third floor. A fence was put up to prevent people from
jumping off the building, and locks were installed on the windows. The
stairs to the roof are equipped with locked iron gates. Now it can be
said that it is completely impossible to jump off the building. The
management has installed with complete suicide prevention devices. Now
it looks like an iron prison.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="history-1">History</h2>
<p>The housing complex was completed in 1973. It was hailed as the
largest complex in Japan at the time, and it still looks grand today.
Five incidents of jumping from buildings occurred that year, but what
made the complex famous was the 1977 incident in which a mother and her
son committed suicide by jumping from a building. For this reason, the
complex was known as the “Mecca of Suicide”. More than ten people
committed suicide every year. In 1980, the number of suicides exceeded
20. By 1982, the total number of suicides reached 100. More than 80% of
the suicides are “expedition suicides” from Shizuoka, Niigata and other
places, namely people traveling for long distances for the specific
purpose of dying there. Some people specifically have bought ladders in
order to climb over the fence outside the house. During the peak suicide
season, there is a suicide every three days.</p>
<p>To this end, 700 million yen was spent in 1981 to install steel
fences and install “life-saving telephones” in the complex, which was a
lot of trouble. Despite this, there are still 19- and 18-year-old men
and women who smashed glass windows with benches, climbed to the eaves
and jumped to their deaths. Perhaps this pair prompted a larger
response, though.</p>
<p>A related official said: “In the past seven years (since the
establishment of the Takashimadaira Police Station), one incident has
only occurred every two or three years. Because of the fence, it is
almost impossible to hear anyone committing suicide.”</p>
<h2 id="how-to-jump-off-a-building">How to jump off a building</h2>
<p>Nowadays, no one will go to Takashimadaira housing complex to jump
anymore, but for those who can’t find a suitable place nearby, or “I’m
old school. I’m still going for Takashimadaira!”, I am here to whisper
to you some of the nice places at Taka.</p>
<p>It seems that the complex where people jumped from buildings has been
completely blocked, but for some reason Block 3-11 (see map) is
completely defenseless. Especially in Building 1 of 3-11, outsiders can
enter and exit the outer corridors from the first to the fourteenth
floors at will. There is only a one-meter-high low grille. The
unprepared situation may even scare the residents. In Buildings 2 to 6
of 3-11, the windows on the corner platform of the stairs do not have
locking devices. As long as you climb up the low wall about 150
centimeters, you can jump off smoothly. Even so, I still recommend the
14th-floor exterior corridor of Building 1 of 3-11, where you can see
the view of the Itabashi area across from the Toei Line. Needless to
say, there is a concrete floor below, and there are few pedestrians. If
you fall, you will definitely die. Moreover, there are no railings on
the outer stairs of this building.</p>

<p>Seppuku has absolutely no benefits, except that it’s rare and
shocking, but why do people keep doing this? It is inexplicable.</p>
<h2 id="cutting-the-wrists-and-carotid">Cutting the wrists and
carotid</h2>
<p>In the middle of the night, alone in your room put a knife to your
wrist and mark some lines as if just testing it out. It doesn’t matter
whether you die or not.</p>
<p>If you have really thought about death, you have probably had this
kind of experience at least once. If you put a knife across your neck,
you can also experience the thrill of death. Cutting your wrists is the
simplest way to experience the air of suicide on the spot. At the same
time, you can observe with your own body and eyes and understand the
entire process of pain and death. Known as “wristcutting syndrome” in
the 1960s, this method of suicide was extremely popular in the United
States, then spread to Europe, and finally Japan. Recently, after singer
Akina Nakamori<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> slit her wrists, “Akina Syndrome”,
a disease in which young women have slit their wrists one after another
in discos around Roppongi, has become one of the most fashionable
suicide methods nowadays.</p>
<p>However, I would not recommend this method to someone who really
wants to commit suicide. Because there is an opinion that the mortality
rate of wrist cutting is only 5%. Although the method is popular, the
attempt rate is high. Having said that, it is not correct to insist that
“you will never die if you cut your wrists.” If the foregoing figures
are to be believed, one in 20 people will die from this method. A former
prosecutor also said: “Not many people die from excessive bleeding just
by cutting their wrists.” This chapter is written for those who hope to
become the 5%.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn’t matter if you don’t intend to die in the first
place but just want to experience suicidal emotions and cut your wrists.
As long as you don’t cause trouble to others, there is no reason for
others to criticize you for that. Furthermore, just like slitting the
wrists, there are other ways to maim the body with a bladed object and
cause massive bleeding to death, such as cutting the carotid artery,
stabbing the chest, or committing seppuku. These self-mutilation
behaviors also result in death due to bleeding, so they are introduced
together in this chapter.</p>
<h3 id="preparation-1">Preparation</h3>

<h4 id="wrist-cut-it-through">Wrist – cut it through!</h4>
Whether cutting the wrist or carotid artery, a sharp knife is enough.
Kitchen knives, razors, paper knives, etc., anything sharp will do. When
cutting your wrists, it is best to drink some alcohol first and then
take a shower to speed up blood circulation. Also, in order to prevent
the bleeding from stopping, you should soak your hands in warm water or
place them in a basin after cutting, otherwise the blood will coagulate
and block the wound. However, it is the unanimous opinion of doctors
that as long as the artery is cut in the wrist, death will occur. Some
professional doctors said: “If you cut open half of the artery, you can
die. If you cut more than half of the artery, it will no longer be
blocked.”
</p>
<p>
It is also important to confirm the location of the cut in advance. If
you want to slit your wrist, you should turn the palm of the less
dexterous hand up, and observe your wrist carefully. Feel for a pulsing
point on the inside of the hand joint. That is the radial artery. Cut
there. There are two oblique veins between the hand artery and the skin,
which cross the radial artery exactly at the creasing point on the
wrist. In order to see their relative positions more clearly, you might
as well press the armpit firmly to make the veins protrude. If you just
cut the vein without doing anything else, the blood flow will stop
naturally at about 200 to 300 c.c., and you will not die. However, even
with this, a considerable amount of blood was shed, and this sight would
often make one no longer want to die.
</p>
<p>
Aiming at the artery under the skin that is not covered by the vein, and
cutting it horizontally, will only cut veins, not arteries. The arteries
are six to seven millimeters below the skin (see Figure 1), which is
deeper than it looks. The artery must be pierced and several cuts must
be made. Even if you aim just right like this, when you actually cut,
you will likely cut the median nerve next to it, which is very painful.
It may be possible to avoid the nerve by cutting lengthwise to the
artery, but it will be difficult, because the artery and the nerve are
too close. If you truly want to die, then you should prepare to endure
the pain and cut the nerve and tendon together. Even if you survive the
attempt, nerves and tendons could be reattached at the hospital. The
ulnar artery has the same thickness, and is on the opposite side of the
pulsing point, so it is better to cut it at the same time. In short, if
you don’t have the determination to cut off your wrist, you won’t die.
</p>
<p>
Also, consider checking the position of the watch strap in case a
suicide attempt leaves scars.
</p>
<h4 id="carotid-artery-puncture-and-then-pull-out">Carotid artery –
puncture and then pull out</h4>
<figure>
<img src="img/4_2.png" alt="Figure 2" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 2</figcaption>
</figure>
As long as the carotid artery is cut, it will die immediately, so there
is no need to worry about what happens after the attempt. However, this
is also a case of real severance.
</p>
<p>
When cutting the carotid artery, the easiest thing to cut is the
external carotid artery under the ear on the side of the hand that is
usually more flexible. You may wish to check the location by comparing
pictures 2 and 3. The carotid artery is located at the height of the
neck and is divided into the internal carotid artery and the external
carotid artery. The blood vessels near the shoulders are thicker and
deeper. The depth below the ear is more than three centimeters, and
there are a lot of thick muscles around it, making it difficult to cut.
In this case, don’t make a horizontal cut, but stab it through
ruthlessly and then pull it out. Sometimes the cut was not done smoothly
and several cuts were required (Case study 11), but there were also
cases where a person carrying a rice bowl fell, and the broken pieces of
the bowl cut the carotid artery, killing the person instantly. It is
also very difficult to cut the carotid artery, but the above-mentioned
cases are not unprecedented.
</p>
<h4
id="other-places-the-heart-is-located-closer-to-the-center-than-generally-imagined">Other
places – the heart is located closer to the center than generally
imagined</h4>
When stabbing the heart, you should feel the chest with your hands to
confirm the position beforehand. The heart is more centrally located
than imagined, and although the depth varies from person to person, it
is about 9 cm deep.
</p>
<p>
Hideki Tojo<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> asked the doctor about the position
of his heart, often touched his chest to confirm the position, and even
had a target drawn to shoot at with a pistol, but it still missed the
mark. (Some people say that, because he was a left-hander, which is rare
among dictators, he fired with his right hand.) There are many examples
of stabbing someone repeatedly without hitting the heart.
</p>
<p>
For seppuku, the blade must be at least 15 cm long. If you can’t apply
enough force and determination to push the blade poking out from the
back, you are not the kind of person who can commit seppuku.
</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<h3 id="wrist-let-it-drain-a-liter-of-blood">Wrist – let it drain a
liter of blood</h3>
“A human being cannot be cut even with full force.” The person who said
this was a 27-year-old woman, who cut the wrist with a thin knife, 5 cm
long and 4–5 cm deep. Yes, the flesh and blood vessels are more
difficult to cut than imagined, and there are tendons on the edges of
the hand arteries, which are even more difficult to cut. She made up her
mind and cut her wrist. The wound opened wide and she saw blood vessels
and white flesh, and then a stream of hot blood came out. Even if you
only cut the vein, the towel you put on it will be stained blood red
immediately. If the artery is cut open, it will spray up to a height of
two to three meters with six times the force of a vein of the same
thickness. However, as the blood flows out, the blood pressure gradually
decreases, and the bleeding will decrease. As for pain, the words of a
22-year-old female college student, who only had her veins cut, are
worth taking as reference. She covered her hands with a towel and said:
“Looking at the bleeding, I was thinking, should I die like this? Or
should I live again? One has to choose this or that. You may not believe
this, but it doesn’t hurt at all. Once upon a time, I cut my wrist when
I was in the second grade of middle school, and I didn’t feel any pain
at that time. It turned out that I could actually die if I did this.”
</p>
<p>
It is natural to feel considerable pain when you cut a nerve. As for the
veins, it’s just the pain of an ordinary cut.
</p>
<p>
However, the problem after cutting is that if the artery is cut
smoothly, one-third of the blood in the body will flow out, and the
person will die. In the human body, men have about 80 ml of blood per kg
of body mass, and women have about 60 ml of blood flowing. Therefore, if
you are a woman weighing 50 kg, you have 3000 ml of blood in your body,
and if one-third of it (1000 ml) flows out, you will die. This is only
equivalent to 2.5 times the 400 ml taken when donating blood. Children
and the elderly may die from even smaller amounts of bleeding. It is
indeed difficult to die by slitting the wrist, but it is still very
simple as long as it is cut reliably and the wound bleeds constantly.
</p>
<h3 id="carotid-artery-spurting-blood-for-twelve-seconds">Carotid artery
– spurting blood for twelve seconds</h3>
What will happen if one completely cuts off either carotid artery on the
left or right? Blood will burst out and splash on the ceiling or wall
for about five seconds. One will become unconscious, one’s brain
function stops, and one dies due to loss of most of one’s blood after
more than ten seconds (according to one study, it is twelve seconds).
Some people believe that when one carotid artery is severed, the other
carotid artery still delivers blood to the brain, and the patient is
still conscious for about three minutes. But the statement of immediate
death is more reliable.
</p>
<p>
It is widely known that marathon runner Kokichi Tsuburaya<a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
committed suicide by severing his carotid artery. He was lying on the
bed and used a double-sided safety blade to cut his right carotid
artery.
</p>
<p>
Similar to the hand, cutting the jugular vein, which is located
shallower than the artery, will also cause massive bleeding. Air will be
sucked in along with the flow of the artery, and the air entering the
blood vessel will block the lungs and cause death. Likewise, if air
enters the trachea, suffocation may occur <sup>60</sup>. However, even
if the carotid artery is cut, there are not many cases where the
bleeding stops and the patient does not die, just like the hand vein.
</p>
<h3 id="other-forms-of-cutting-the-coward-will-not-die-by-seppuku">Other
forms of cutting – the coward will not die by seppuku</h3>
During seppuku, many small abdominal blood vessels that are not fatal
will be cut off first, and then the blade will injure the small
intestine, causing the stool to overflow and cause death by peritonitis.
Of course, he will not die immediately. It is said that he will die
after three or four days. The death of professional wrestler Rikidozan
was also due to peritonitis after being stabbed in a street fight with
the yakuza. When the knife is inserted into the abdomen, it causes
peritoneal shock and is usually too painful to continue.
</p>
<p>
However, if the deep stabbing reaches the back, then the main artery in
front of the back bone will be cut, which will cause massive bleeding
and immediate death. Regardless of gender, old or young, quite a few
people died using this method. When doing it, the knife should not be
inserted and kept there, but should be pulled out immediately.
Otherwise, the knife will block the bleeding.
</p>
<p>
When the heart is pierced, if the puncture is accurate, death will occur
on the spot, but the tissue structure of the heart is quite tough. A
housewife who committed suicide with a thick-edged kitchen knife had
three holes in her heart. This means that she did not die all at once. A
carpenter attempted suicide by driving three long nails into his heart.
The nails blocked the wound and prevented internal hemorrhage. He died
of bleeding during the operation after being sent to the hospital.
</p>
<p>
No matter which method is used, it is generally difficult to commit
suicide by bleeding.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>60</sup> This sentence may be wrong. The author should refer to
air embolism caused by large amounts of air entering the blood vessels.
Generally speaking, if more than 100 ml of air is injected into the vein
or the air injection rate exceeds 100 ml/s, death will occur. More than
2 ml of air in the cerebral blood vessels can cause death, and more than
0.5ml of air in the coronary arteries can cause death.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="corpse-appearance-sea-of-blood-is-just-a-metaphor">Corpse
appearance: “Sea of ​​blood” is just a metaphor</h2>
<p>When the carotid artery is cut, some books describe it as “a sea of
​​blood all around”. In fact, it is just a situation where several liters
of blood flow to the floor, sometimes splashing on the ceiling or walls,
or at least a puddle of blood, but the floor is not completely covered
with blood. No, Tsuburaya’s room didn’t turn into a sea of ​​blood.</p>
<p>In the case of seppuku, if the abdomen is cut transversely with a
knife, a bucket of intestines will flow out, which is extremely
ugly.</p>
<h2 id="note-4">Note</h2>
<h3 id="you-will-not-die-if-you-cut-your-arm-veins">You will not die if
you cut your arm veins</h3>
<p>If you definitely want to cut your arm veins and die slowly and
happily, it is best to drink some wine and take a bath to smoothen the
blood circulation. Place your hands below the heart in the bathtub and
be careful not to let the blood coagulate and wait for death to come. It
is possible to drown if you are slightly unconscious, but when you
regain consciousness, this is not euthanasia, but you will feel the pain
of suffocation. Therefore, be careful not to drown. Also, when cutting
the neck, it is best to lie on your side to keep the heart positioned
upward.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>When blood flows out slowly, other internal organs that are not
directly related to maintaining life will replenish some blood during
this period. This is a situation where the patient cannot die without
losing nearly 70% of the blood. This means that it is impossible to die
by cutting the veins in your arms.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> If someone dies due to
vein cutting, it is usually because the air sucked into the vein blocks
the blood vessels of the brain or lungs, and the death is caused by air
embolism. However, this is extremely rare.</p>
<h3 id="cost-of-a-suicide-gesture">Cost of a suicide gesture</h3>
<p>When you first think of wristcutting and the consequences of a failed
attempt, you’d be worried about the scars. When only the vein was cut,
even if it is very deep, it would heal to just a white mark, which
looked similar to a wrinkle on the wrist. But if you cut the artery, you
will also cut the tendons on the next layer and the median nerve in the
center of the wrist on the same layer. Although the tendons and nerves
are severed, they could be reconnected through surgery (Case study 12).
However, if one makes a longitudinal cut, the stitches and scars after
surgery will be conspicuous. Plastic surgery can help, but medical
expenses can range from tens to hundreds of thousands of yen.</p>
<p>The cost of suturing the wrist vein is about 30,000 yen, which covers
30% of the medical insurance. As a price for a suicide gesture, it is
relatively cheap.<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"

study 11: Thoughts of a female high school student who had her arteries
and nerves cut off</h2>
<p>In 1985, a sixteen-year-old female high school student slashed her
wrists with a knife. The wound damaged an artery and produced a liter of
blood, but the attempt ended in failure. She said this about the
situation at that time: “It was painful after all, and a lot of blood
flowed, but she was still awake, so she cut several more times. It hurt!
When the thick blood vessels were cut, blood spurted out. When it came
out, there was a hissing sound. I thought I would die like this, but it
still didn’t work, so I cut it again. It seemed like I had cut a nerve
and I felt numb. I was taken to the hospital. When I was undergoing
treatment, I thought it would be better to give me an injection of
anesthesia, because I am already averse to pain.”</p>
<p>From the second grade of middle school, she still talked and laughed
in front of everyone, but when she was alone with her friends, there was
no topic of conversation, and she always felt distressed that she could
not speak. She wanted to go to a neurological department for a check-up,
but she never could speak up to make the request.</p>
<p>The situation under she decided to commit suicide was described thus:
“After dinner, I had do to homework, and I was thinking”I can’t not do
it. I can’t not do it.” I suddenly thought that if I die, wouldn’t there
be no more of homework? Under such circumstances, my mood gradually
shifted to “I can’t not die. I can’t not die.” But she also said: “It
took seconds for me to decide to take action.” and then continued: “I
have thought about it a long time ago, that with death all pain would
end. Although I thought I should live on, I knew that if I die, I don’t
have to do those things I don’t want to do, and I don’t have to think
about those painful things.” When I knew I could not die: “I wonder if
someone had discovered me earlier, ah!”</p>
<p>As a result, she stayed in the psychiatric ward for four months and
was finally discharged after undergoing physical and mental
recuperation.</p>
<h3 id="check-this-example-4">Check: this example</h3>
<p>It seemed that she had cut the arteries and central nerves in her
hand. It was very painful to cut to this extent. Her idea that “pain
will be nothing if you die” is very insightful.</p>

<p>At about 4:30 pm on July 11, 1989, when the popular singer Masahiko
Kondō returned to her apartment, he found that his lover, Akina Nakamori
(24 years old at the time), also a popular singer, had cut into her left
elbow joint with a razor, and was lying in a pool of blood. Blood of
about five large cups’ volume were shed in the bathroom where she
collapsed. She was unconscious. It seemed that she had cut her wrists
shortly before she was discovered. She was immediately sent to the
hospital of the Jikei University School of Medicine. The wound was eight
centimeters long and two centimeters deep. The vein and median nerve
were cut, and the suturing operation took six hours. General anesthesia
was performed during the operation, the blood pressure dropped to about
60 mmHg, and 600 ml of blood was transfused. After the operation, the
arm was bandaged with a plaster for a period of time in order to prevent
the veins and nerves from being broken again. She later recuperated at a
hot spring in Nakaizu and is now fully recovered. The sequelae of being
unable to bend the fingers and losing feeling in the thumb, index
finger, and middle finger that she was worried about at first did not
appear, and the scars were not visible.</p>
<p>The motive for the suicide attempt is believed to be emotional
difficulties with Kondō.</p>
<h3 id="check-this-example-5">Check: this example</h3>
<p>This is an example of a suicide attempt by cutting the blood vessels
on the inside of the elbow, which could easily be dismissed as a boring
case of faked suicide. But the length of eight centimeters is the length
from one end of the inside of the elbow to the other end, and the depth
is two centimeters, which is a considerable degree of serious injury.
The wound must be wide open, and if an artery is cut, it will definitely
be life-threatening. This means it’s probably a genuine attempt.</p>
<p>The median nerve, which controls the movement and sensation of the
hand, is about one centimeter below the skin (see Figure 4). There is
also a thick artery nearby, also one centimeter below the skin. It is
the perfect place for suicide. It’s a miracle that she didn’t cut into
this artery. Some doctors said: “It probably was not being cut
longitudinally?” However, it is generally believed that the opening is
only two centimeters deep, and it is not actually cut to two
centimeters. Two centimeters, that’s deep enough to reach the bone.</p>

study 13: Mitsutaka Shimada, the Nisshō Iwai executive, who survived
even stabbing himself all over</h2>
<p>The body of Mr. Mitsutaka Shimada (then 56 years old) was found on a
February morning in 1979, under the building of the trading company
Nisshō Iwai, of which he was an executive. The so-called Douglas–Grumman
bribery scandal was a case that, along with the Lockheed bribery
scandals, involved the political and financial circles of Japan and
became a hot topic at the time.</p>
<p>Shimada’s body had knife marks on his right neck and left wrist, and
several awl marks on his chest. The cause of death was hemorrhage and
brain trauma. The brain trauma was caused when he jumped from the
president’s office on the seventh floor of the building. He was wearing
a shirt, knee-length underpants, a suit jacket, and socks only on his
right foot when he died.</p>
<p>At around 10:30 the night before, he said to the members who had
stayed behind to work overtime, “You can go now.” Then he tidied up the
room, took off his clothes, cut his neck and wrists with a knife, and
stabbed his chest with an awl at several places. But none of them were
fatal. After hours of pain, he finally climbed up to the
70-centimeter-high window sill with all his strength and jumped out of
the seventh-floor window. The sock on his left foot was left by the
window. He probably slipped off it when he was climbing over the window
sill due to blood. There were also blood stains in the restroom five
meters away from the president’s office. This was because he went to the
restroom due to incontinence due to shock caused by heavy bleeding.
Shimada’s struggle with death was extremely miserable. He fell into a
coma several times due to bleeding, and every time he regained
consciousness, he slashed at his body. This was repeated many times, and
it seemed that it took a long time.</p>
<p>The carpet in the room was naturally stained red with blood. Freshly
opened bottles of Suntory Whiskey and tea bowls were scattered around.
The table was neatly arranged as if to reflect his personality during
his lifetime, and nine suicide notes were left behind. Pants, coats,
scarves, shirts, etc. were neatly placed in the middle of the sofa,
which showed that he had made careful preparations for suicide.</p>
<p>He was regarded as an important witness to the incident at that time
and was the right-hand man of the ex-vice president, Kaifu Hachiro, who
was the central character in the scandle, and later arrested in July
1979. Therefore, there is no doubt that he committed suicide due to this
incident. Two days before the suicide, Kaifu had held a press
conference.</p>
<p>His suicide note left to the members read, “The life of the company
is eternal, and we should dedicate ourselves to safeguard its
eternity.”</p>
<h3 id="check-this-example-6">Check: this example</h3>
<p>This is a vivid example of the difficulty of committing suicide
through self-harm. In fact, self-harm suicide, like suicide by
poisoning, has a particularly high attempt rate. This man first cut his
wrists, then his neck, and then stabbed his chest with an awl. In fact,
if he had chosen to jump off the building in the first place, there
would have been no need for him to suffer so much unnecessary
suffering.</p>
<p>One thing that should not be ignored is that when he was about to
pass out while hacking his body with a knife, he went to the bathroom.
Among other means of suicide, defecation often occurs when the person is
in shock but is still conscious. Since you can make thorough
preparations for tidying up your room and laying out your suicide note,
you should go to the bathroom first. Although it is self-inflicted, one
should not stab and chop blindly, as this will not kill him. However, it
is really unusual of him to repeatedly go to the bathroom during the
suicide process, just to make sure others do not see the signs of
incontinence.</p>

<p>The corpses will be bruised and bloody; the suspension of electric
trains will cause great obstruction. However, this method can indeed
lead to death when one is determined to die, so it is becoming more and
more popular.</p>
<p>Dragging an extremely tired body out of the company or school, just
thinking about tomorrow makes you feel extremely heavy. At this time,
you stood on the platform and heard the announcement that the train was
arriving. “I don’t want to think about the future anymore, I really want
to be a ghost-under-the-wheel<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> here and end
everything…” There must be many people who have such thoughts in their
minds. Although people knew that their miserable corpses would be
exposed in front of people, people who died after crashing into trains
kept appearing. Perhaps this method was perfect for the impulsive desire
to commit suicide.</p>
<p>When it comes to suicide by vehicle, the easiest one is railway
suicide, followed by hitting a truck on the road. However, according to
statistics from the Metropolitan Police Department in 1991, 179 people
committed suicide on tracks inside stations, and 78 people on railway
tracks not inside stations. There were only four suicides by cars on the
road. In other words, except for jumping into the sea or lake, more than
99% of the accidents did not hit ordinary vehicles but hit trains and
trains. Among them, most of them lie on the railway track outside
instead of inside the station.</p>
<p>There are more people lying on railway tracks than ordinary car
crashes. This may be because this method has a high death rate. It is a
sure-fire method like hanging or jumping off a building. If you want to
crash and die, then hit the train without hesitation!</p>
<p>According to statistics from the former National Railways
Metropolitan Area Headquarters, the months with the most people lying on
railway tracks are July and August, between 6 and 7 o’clock in the
evening, which is slightly different from statistics on other suicide
methods. Men account for 77% of the gender. Another interesting thing is
that more people commit suicide on cloudy days.</p>
<h2 id="preparation-2">Preparation</h2>
<h3 id="wait-at-the-station-where-the-express-train-passes">Wait at the
station where the express train passes</h3>
<p>When jumping off the platform at a station, choose a “non-stop”
option for limited express or direct express trains. The fatality rate
of a decelerating train will also be reduced. If it is stopping at a
station, you should choose the farthest train entry point on the
platform.</p>
<p>Jumping suddenly and unexpectedly will have an impact on those around
you. Although it is not bad, if the timing is too late, it will hit the
front of the car and be bounced off, possibly surviving. If the force of
the jump is too strong, you may overshoot and flop onto the other side
of the track.</p>
<p>There is no need to fumble it with anxiety. When the train entering
the station is more than 100 meters in front of you, even if it brakes
immediately, it is too late. The train would have been already braking
as it is entering the station, so the emergency brake wouldn’t help.
Probably they will not stop you if you calmly jump onto the track and
lie there. A 42-year-old company employee came down from the platform to
the track and lay prone there waiting for the arrival of the tram.
Finally, the train ran over him, crushing his head and right leg, and he
died on the spot.</p>
<p>A Yamanote Line train entered Tokyo Station at a speed of 57 km/h. It
braked suddenly because a man jumped off the track 30 meters in front of
it. However, due to inertia, it still drove forward for more than 100
meters, and the man was crushed. It was broken into pieces, and the
brain matter burst out from the back of his head. He died on the spot.
At this time, you should remember that the train siren will be so loud
that it will almost deafen your ears.</p>
<h3 id="act-at-night">Act at night</h3>
<p>When lying on the track some distance away from the station, try to
choose a spot that is behind a sudden bend, so that it is hidden from
the driver. It’s also a good idea to take a train beforehand and observe
areas at the front of the train that the driver doesn’t pay much
attention to. Once you find a suitable place, you can lie down on the
track and wait for the train. However, you will hear a rumbling roar
when the train approaches. It is said that in this situation, you would
panic and cannot stay put, not if you are a normal mental state, so it
is best to take some alcohol, sleeping pills, sedatives, etc. However,
there was also a third-year high school female student who was run over
by the train when she jumped from the uplink platform of Shizuoka
Station to the track and stood still facing the “Hikari” train<a
href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> traveling at a speed of 200 km/h.
This is truly an example of courage that makes people want to bow down
in respect.</p>
<p>It is also more difficult for trains to stop on ordinary routes. A
train traveling at a speed of 90 km/h braked suddenly when it found a
figure 200 meters ahead. However, the train stopped where it ran over
the person and then traveled another 200 meters. According to the data,
the distance until the train stops after emergency braking is
<code>s^2/20 + s/2</code>, where <code>s</code> is the speed at the time
of breaking.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>In terms of time, you should definitely choose night time. Neither
the people around nor the driver would notice you easily.</p>
<p>If you have difficulty entering the rail track area, you can either
quickly run in from the level crossing, or jump from the pedestrian
bridge. There are many cases of jumping from the level crossing. There
are actually many ways to enter the track area. (See Case study 16)</p>
<h3 id="instant-certain-death">Instant certain death</h3>
<p>If you lie down on the track from the beginning, any part of your
head, abdomen, chest, hands and feet lying on the track will be crushed.
As long as the chest and head are crushed, you will die on the spot. If
the clothes are caught by a vehicle, they will be dragged up for more
than ten meters, and then the body will roll multiple times and various
parts will be run over multiple times. The crushed corpses will be
scattered for hundreds of meters. This will most likely happen when
jumping from a platform or breaking in from a level crossing.</p>
<p>The kinetic energy of the train is so great that sometimes shoes or
bags will hit people on the platform, which indicates that the person is
dead. A man flew into a train traveling at 85 km/h. As a result, his
hands, legs, and body were crushed to pieces and scattered within a
hundred meters. His head was missing.</p>
<p>Being crushed by a Shinkansen train was even worse, as if the body
had been stirred by a blender. Near Sagamino plateau, a man suddenly
squatted on the track 300 meters in front of the “Hikari” train
traveling at 200 kilometers per hour, with his back to the train. A
cloud of dust. Blood splattering everywhere. Scattered within 400 – 500
meters were his mostly intact liver, parts of the scalp and hair, about
30 cm of the spine connected to the pelvis, a bit of skin from the neck
and jaw, the right wrist, three teeth, etc. The other parts became
pieces of meat and bones scattered farther away. After braking, the
train traveled forward for three or four kilometers before stopping.</p>
<h3 id="red-mist-falls-like-rain">Red mist falls like rain</h3>
<p>The aforementioned girl, who was standing on the track, was hit by
the “Hikari” train. Her upper body hit the platform wall 30 meters away
and then bounced back to the platform. Then her clothes and sunglasses
also flew towards the same place. A bloody mist appeared. The sales
department on the descending platform said that they only heard a dull
and loud bang, and their eyes suddenly turned red. So, what is the force
that causes body fragments or items to be ejected with such
violence?</p>
<p>If the body collides with the front of an ordinary train, it will be
ejected five to six meters if the train is moving. At this time, there
are many cases of death due to instantaneous cardiac arrest. In this
case, if you still fall on the track after being ejected, your body will
be crushed. But if you fall outside the track, unfortunately, you can
still survive.</p>
<h2 id="corpse-appearance-flesh-and-blood-flying-everywhere">Corpse
appearance: Flesh and blood flying everywhere</h2>
<p>This is the most brutal-looking of all suicide methods, and you
should be mentally prepared for it. However, unless the crash is at a
station or a level crossing, the body will not be seen by ordinary
passengers and onlookers. Sometimes the bodies that were knocked out
showed no damage on the surface. In this case, the damage to the
internal organs is severe.</p>
<p>The station staff usually disposes the body and cleans up the
surroundings in about ten minutes, but after thirty minutes they might
still have not found the crushed hands or neck. A man who committed
suicide had his face attached to a truck and was discovered after
traveling 900 km from Fukushima Prefecture to Hokkaido. There is also an
example where the arm of a woman who was hit in Yamaguchi Prefecture was
discovered after traveling 900 km to Yokohama.</p>
<p>Although the bodies were removed and the trains resumed running, bits
and pieces were scattered everywhere, and the sleepers and paving roads
were still stained with blood, leaving tragic traces. If someone is
crushed to death by lying on the track outside the station area, it is
less likely that the body will be left crushed into two or three pieces.
In short, this is definitely not a suitable method for people who want
to die as a connected piece of meat.</p>
<h2 id="note-5">Note</h2>
<h3 id="the-track-and-the-body-should-be-at-right-angles">The track and
the body should be at right angles</h3>
<p>You may get unlucky, and your hands and feet are crushed but not
fatally, and you may have to rely on prosthetics for the rest of your
life (Case study 15). To avoid this, let your neck or chest lie on the
track. Sometimes the body would get caught in the middle of the track
and miraculously you would only scratch the skin a little (Case study
14). Therefore, making the body and the rails cross at right angles is
the basic method of suicide on rails.</p>
<h3 id="be-prepared-to-pay-huge-compensation">Be prepared to pay huge
compensation</h3>
<p>Railway suicides can result in huge compensation bills. According to
statistics from the old National Railways in 1985, an emergency braking
of a train will cause 6,000 to 8,000 yen in power loss and about 10,000
yen in wheel wear costs. If a train stops once, for Tokyo’s Yamanote
Line, which has a large number of passengers, hundreds of thousands of
yen will be lost every 15 to 30 minutes. During peak hours, it will
cause losses of 1 to 2 million yen. The damage cost of the Shinkansen is
even greater, tens of millions of yen for one hour of delay. In
addition, there are fees for housing the deceased. There is also an
example of a car crashing into a limited express train and being asked
for 30 million yen in compensation, and an example of a car crashing
into a Tokaido line and being asked for 140 million yen in compensation.
People who know the inside story said that the railway companies
typically do not claim compensation for the sake of public opinion. But
Japan Railways is not a nice guy. Although they might not file a legal
case, they might still attempt to get some financial compensation.
However, there are many cases where the contact address of the
deceased’s family members is unclear, and so they cannot obtain
compensation.</p>
<p>From this point of view, committing suicide by lying on the train is
not a cost-effective method. Still, as mentioned at the beginning, when
you suddenly wants to die, this is the method that appears ready-made in
front of you. If you want to die without waiting, it is of course the
best solution for such impatient people. Render unto Caesar the things
that are Caesar’s, and unto the future the troubles that are the
future’s.</p>
<h2
id="case-study-14-ms.-ol-who-miraculously-survived-under-a-train">Case
study 14: Ms. OL, who miraculously survived under a train</h2>
<p>At around 5 p.m. on December 29, 1991, a 24-year-old woman, OL,
attempted suicide by jumping onto a moving train on the Musashino Line
from an overpass 500 meters in front of Nishi-Funabashi Station. She was
a single woman, working at a computer company in Chiba City, and she was
on her way home from get off work at the time. The overpass is 7 meters
high. If she had fallen in just the right posture, she would have died
even if there was no train passing. She jumped onto the track when the
train was 10 meters away from her. Then the train passed by, and the
driver also felt, “She’s crushed!” The train braked immediately and
stopped. She was under the 6th carriage, counting backwards from the
last one. Her body happened to be sandwiched between two rails and she
was not injured. The doctor diagnosed her with contusions on the head
and waist that required treatment for a week. She was saved because she
had a small body, her back was not hooked by the vehicle, and the train
slowed down before it entered the station. Otherwise, the body will be
roped into the wheels and she would be crushed to death.</p>
<p>Although she did not say the motive for committing suicide, her
friends said that it was related to her recent relationship troubles
with a man.</p>
<h3 id="check-this-example-7">Check: this example</h3>
<p>Jumping off a building and crashing into a car, this is a rare
example of using two highly lethal means at the same time, but still
surviving. Usually, even a person who jumped from a height of 7 meters
would suffer serious injuries. In addition, the train passed on top, but
in the end, she only suffered minor contusions. This is indeed a
miracle. It is another miracle that she did not plan to sandwich the
body in the middle of the rails beforehand, but did so accidentally.
Wasn’t there a female suicide, popularly called a “Human Bullet”<a
href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>, who also jumped from an overpass
towards a train? She smashed the front panel of the cab,, fell inside
the cab, and died there.</p>
<p>There is a question worth thinking about, that is the day and time
when she decided to commit suicide. December 29, 1991 is Sunday. The
work was supposed to end the day before or two days ago, so why did she
stay in the company until after five o’clock in the evening? What was
she doing?</p>
<p>Regardless, she was determined to commit suicide. However, because of
this unexpected situation, it is difficult to say that suicide will
definitely be successful if this is done.</p>
<h2

study 15: A woman who survived a railway suicide attempt, losing one
hand and two feet</h2>
<p>In February 1955, Ms. T attempted suicide by crashing her car, but
failed. She was a 16-year-old grade-11 high school student at the time.
At about ten o’clock in the evening, she rushed to the express train
that had just departed from Shinjuku Station on the Odakyu Line, and
“jumped off as if she was attracted by the railway” from the front of
the platform. The train braked suddenly and stopped. T’s right ankle,
the part below the knee of his left foot, 15 cm below the shoulder of
his left hand, and the ring finger and little finger of his right hand
were all broken. All that is left are the thumb, index finger and middle
finger of the left hand. At that time, T screamed desperately: “It’s
hot, it’s hot!” and soon lost consciousness. She was taken to the
hospital by ambulance and was in a coma for a week. When she regained
consciousness and learned of her condition, it was the tenth day after
the accident. T once thought in despair: “I have no choice but to die
again.” Later, she believed in the words of a Christian pastor and the
Bible and decided to live on. She was discharged from the hospital in
August and both legs were fitted with prosthetics. She married the
pastor the next year, had two children, and is now engaged in speaking
engagements promoting the preciousness of life.</p>
<h3 id="check-this-example-8">Check: this example</h3>
<p>It was her fault to collide with the train that had just started from
the front of the platform, but it was probably just an accident that her
neck, body and other parts that could have been fatally injured were not
crushed. However, this example also shows that the faster the train, the
better. However, even a train that has just started has the power to
break hands and feet. This is a rare example of failed railway
suicide.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-16-woman-crushed-to-death-in-seikan-tunnel">Case
study 16: Woman crushed to death in Seikan Tunnel</h2>
<p>In March 1991, the body of a 26-year-old woman was discovered near
the Yoshioka-Kaitei Station in the Seikan Tunnel under the Tsugaru
Strait that separates Honshu and Hokkaido. Both hands and legs were
completely cut off above the forehead. However, Yoshioka-Kaitei Station
is a disaster backup station among the two unmanned stations in the
Seikan Tunnel, which is located on the side of the tunnel. The trains do
not stop there, so it is not a place that ordinary people can walk into
at will. How could she die in such a place?</p>
<p>Investigation results showed that this woman had been missing since
the day before yesterday. She decided to return home to Tokyo on the
18th, and the incident occurred on her way home from Sapporo. She had
suffered a nervous breakdown not long ago, and she had made up her mind
to die. She took the express train that departed at 22:00 on the same
day. When she passed Yoshioka-Kaitei Station at about 3:50 the next day,
she climbed up while the train was slowing down. After entering the
driver’s room, he opened the window and jumped out. Then she lay down on
the railroad track on the other side and was crushed to death by a truck
passing by around four o’clock.</p>
<p>On the same day (18th), she called home and told her father, “I’m
going home soon.”</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-5">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>Lying on the tracks and waiting to die is very difficult, especially
in an urban area. But the “tunnel suicide” she invented can be used in
urban areas. Going around to find the blindspots in the city is also fun
in preparing for railway suicide. It seems that the subway also has many
blindspot places.</p>
<p>The main condition for walking within the driving route is that the
surroundings must be dark. Don’t let others see you when entering a
level crossing in an urban area. This is more likely at night and
difficult for drivers to spot. In fact, the female corpse was only
discovered an hour and a half later, around 05:40, which means the
driver was completely unaware of it.</p>
<p>It is also important to cut off completely above the forehead. You
can imagine the huge cutting power of train wheels. It was assumed that
she was lying on the tracks, based on the condition of the body. If you
leap in front of a car, you will most likely be crushed to bits. If you
lie straight on your back, you will be cut cleanly into segments. This
is a great inspiration for those who attempt to commit suicide by lying
on the train tracks somewhere other than at the station.</p>
<p>In the plot of Nishimura Kyotaro’s mystery novel <em>Seikan Murder
Express Train Route</em> (青函特急殺人ルート), there is a female corpse
found at Yoshioka-Kaitei Station. Maybe she has read this novel.</p>
<p>Having said that, it is unimaginable to be able to lie on the rails
and wait for more than ten minutes in the biting cold darkness on the
seabed 150 meters below the ground. It is unimaginable for ordinary
people to have an extremely terrifying experience that exceeds ordinary
fears. The psychology before suicide is really hard to understand.</p>
<h1 id="map_3">Map 3: Mount Mihara</h1>
<p>Like other suicide spots that became famous, nowadays there may not
be many people who would still go to Mount Mihara to commit suicide.
However, the volcano has the advantage of swallowing up the corpses
forever. The crater forbids human approach, and there is no large-scale
search for corpses like in Aokigahara. From this point of view, it still
has its uses, so it is introduced here.</p>

<h2 id="history-2">History</h2>
<p>How did Mount Mihara on the island of Oshima, one of the Izu Islands,
become a suicide spot? Not many people know about it now, and the cause
can be traced back to a mysterious Case study 60 years ago. On February
24, 1933, two 21-year-old female students from a women’s vocational
school climbed to Mount Mihara. One of them said “regards to everyone”
and jumped into the crater, while the other was rescued while
hesitating. The two were planning to commit suicide together. This alone
was enough to shock the people around them. After investigation, it was
found that the female student had climbed Mount Mihara with another
friend a month ago on January 9th, which also shocked the friend. She
committed suicide and returned. The “death guide” incident caused a
sensation in society. For unknown reasons, suiciders, mainly young men
and women, flocked to Mount Mihara. Within three months, 32 suicides and
67 attempted suicides occurred, shocking all of Japan.</p>
<p>The real situation is that the girl who became the “death guide” was
entrusted by someone to accompany someone to commit suicide a month ago.
Then, a month later, someone accidentally confided in her the idea of
​​​​suicide, so she told them of Mount Mihara. Little did she know that
person coerced her to be a guide, so she had no choice but to take her
friends to the crater.</p>
<p>As a result, in this year alone, 804 men and 140 women suicided at
Mount Mihara, a total of 944. There were even some who jumped in
together after meeting for the first time at the top of the mountain.
There were some who said to tourists, “Goodbye everyone.” before jumping
in. The man jumped down. As a result, Mount Mihara suddenly became a
suicide spot.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-jump-in">How to jump in</h2>
<p>From the resting area around the crater, or the souvenir shop at the
top of the mountain, walk towards the inner ring of the caldera of Mount
Mihara. Around the crater, only the top of the inner ring is off-limits.
You cannot peek into the crater. If you want to jump, you can only climb
over the fence quickly (see Figure 1). When jumping into a volcano
crater, there are many cases where you would end up smashing and getting
stuck on a rock shelter halfway, or fall to the bottom of a volcano but
not into the magma (Case study 17). However, you can also become
comatose due to inhaling toxic volcanic gases, plus the injuries
sustained when it rolled and fell, death would occur within a few
hours.</p>
<p>Although it is not related to Mount Mihara, a young man followed
Osamu Dazai in 1948 and left a suicide note “Take me with you.” and
threw himself into Mount Aso. He fell onto a rock 150 meters high, and
was finally pulled up. In fact, according to survey data, 240 meters
down from Aso Pass, the temperature of the rock is 100 degrees and the
temperature of the air is 65.6 degrees.</p>
<p>When jumping down, be careful not to let people on the observation
deck on the top of the mountain notice you.</p>
<h2 id="transportation-and-accommodation-1">Transportation and
accommodation</h2>
<p>There are boats to Oshima from Tokyo, Yokohama, Atami, and Ito, and
direct flights from Haneda and Chōfu. If you go to the top of Mount
Mihara, you can take a bus or a taxi.</p>
<p>There’s accommodation at the Oshima Hot Spring Hotel in the eighth
section of Mount Mihara. There are also large and small hotels in
Motomachi and Okada at the port, as well as farmer’s inns. It is not a
bad idea to stay for a few days before committing suicide.</p>
<h1
id="case-study-17-man-who-climbed-up-the-wall-of-mount-mihara-caldera">Case
study 17: Man who climbed up the wall of Mount Mihara caldera</h1>
<p>At about 01:00 pm on December 3, 1956, a young man (29 years old) and
a woman (26 years old) jumped from Mount Mihara into a volcano about 60
meters deep. Mount Mihara had a large-scale erruption during January of
that year. When the two jumped in, one could still see the new crater
caused by the magma eruption.</p>
<p>The rescuers who received the news braved the eruption of unbearable
heat and sulfurous gas to rescue him. The woman’s leg was stuck in one
of the three places where the lava flames were burning, and she could
not move. There was no possibility of rescue. The man was slightly away
from the flames, covered in blood and moaning. Since he was still
conscious, the rescuers carried the man, whose legs were injured, on
their backs, and moved him to a safer place that was more than ten
meters above the rocks. By now, it was already late at night, so they
turned back to the crater rim, and it was already 03:15.</p>
<p>But when they went to rescue him again early the next morning, the
man had already climbed up to the crater shore on his own power and
collapsed there. Unable to use his legs at all, he tore his scarf and
bandaged his head and hands. He dug two holes in the volcano wall with
his hands. He put his knees on the holes and climbed up. He dug two more
holes and climbed up. Repeatedly. He completely climbed up the remaining
crater wall with an inclination of about 70 degrees, finishing at around
4 o’clock in the morning. It was a 15-hour fight for life. His face was
darkened due to blood coagulation, and his left eye was bruised and
swollen, but he only suffered minor injuries. The scarf beside him had
turned yellow and tattered.</p>
<p>The dead woman was pulled out at about 11 o’clock in the morning. The
left thigh and the left shin were burnt to nothing, the stomach was
swollen with gas, but the face and hands were unchanged.</p>
<p>The motive for committing suicide was said to be to clean up the
triangle relationship that had existed for several years.</p>
<h2 id="check-this-example-9">Check: this example</h2>
<p>The force of life is amazing. He said afterwards that, when he was
left on the rock by the rescue team, “I wanted to jump again, but then
the child’s face appeared in front of my eyes, and the belief to live
came up.” Such a person should have never attempted suicide in the first
place.</p>
<p>It was a rare case to jump off a cliff with a slope of 70 and a depth
of 60 meters, but only slightly injured. However, it is extremely rare
to jump into a volcano crater and jump directly into the magma. Most of
them would hit a rock halfway and tumble to the bottom of the crater,
then die from the heat and gas. Enough is said about the horror of
volcanic caldera. He described the scene when climbing the volcanic
wall: “Due to the fierce heat and the sulfur smoke that was sprayed up,
my face was hot and I couldn’t breathe.”</p>
<p>The woman successfully touched the magma and achieved her goal, but
her body was horrific.</p>
<p>This story illustrates that when committing suicide in a volcanic
crater, the location of the fall and the will to die are both very
important.</p>

<p>Connect a pipe from the car’s exhaust outlet to the car window and
block the gap. It is quite time-consuming and laborious, but it can lead
to an easy death and the death is not too ugly.</p>
<p>To avoid making mistakes, I want to make it clear that it is
impossible to die so happily if you rely on city gas. Turning on the gas
switch in a room, then collapsing and drifting into unconsciousness… is
a thing of the past. Today’s city gas, because the gas company has
changed the gas of the past to natural gas that does not contain carbon
monoxide that causes poisoning, poisoning deaths will not occur except
in some areas. Liquefied gas also does not contain carbon monoxide. Even
if you died, it would just be due to suffocation due to lack of oxygen.
The pain felt by death by poisoning and death by lack of oxygen are
completely different. Generally speaking, death by poisoning is a
relatively comfortable way to die. Gone are the happy 1970s when you
could easily poison yourself in your room. However, car exhaust
containing carbon monoxide is still deadly. In fact, most of today’s
“gas suicides” have been replaced by this exhaust gas.</p>
<p>If you want to use gas or propane gas, you have to be prepared to
endure pain that is worse than death. You can suck the gas pipe with
your mouth, fill the small room with gas, and eventually die from lack
of oxygen. If you are lucky, like the 17-year-old girl, you will
suffocate to death the moment the tube is opened. Having said that, some
homes are equipped with safety devices that automatically stop
discharging after a few hours after a large amount of gas is emitted,
and there is also the risk of explosion. Therefore, it is best not to
consider gas suicide at home.</p>
<p>If you want to die from lack of oxygen, there is no need to fill the
room with gas, just cover your head with a plastic bag. Although it
seems a bit primitive, more than a hundred people commit suicide every
year using this method. In addition to plastic bags, the effect will be
better if other methods such as drugs are used to commit suicide at the
same time (Case study 19).</p>
<p>Similarly, although people did not die from poisoning, there were
also people who filled the room with gas and set it on fire. This method
is simple and suitable for people who commit suicide impulsively.
However, although bombing has the effect of killing someone on the spot,
in fact there are many cases of people being burned all over their
bodies and suffering pain for several days before dying again. This
causes great harm to the surroundings, and there is no guarantee whether
it will be completed smoothly. Sometimes it will only cause a fire.
That’s all, so it’s not worth recommending.</p>
<h3 id="preparation-fill-the-fuel-tank-with-gasoline">Preparation: Fill
the fuel tank with gasoline</h3>
<p>To commit suicide in a car, you must first prepare a three to four
meter long rubber tube and tape. The rubber hose should be purchased at
the grocery store according to the thickness of the exhaust port. If the
thickness is wrong, you can wrap it with a few more layers of tape so
that it will neither leak nor fall off. Then connect the rubber tube to
the exhaust port and secure it firmly with tape. Then insert the rubber
tube through the window and seal the window seam tightly with tape. In
this way, the interior of the car becomes sealed. You sit in it, close
the door, start the engine, put down the seat, listen to the music
played by the speakers in the car, and slowly drift towards permanent
sleep.</p>
<p>Be sure to fill up the tank with gas. If your neighbors aren’t paying
attention, you can park your car in your own garage, but it’s better to
park it in a forest where people can’t see it. It’s also an excellent
place to park your car in an out-of-season vacation spot because no one
would be snooping around. Or cover it with a car cover so that no one
will notice the indicator light of the stereo even if you are listening
to music.</p>

</figure>
<p>When committing suicide in a room, first confirm whether the gas used
contains carbon monoxide, and also check whether there is a safety
device. The only thing left is to seal the window cracks tightly,
whether you die of carbon monoxide poisoning or lack of oxygen, put more
tape on the window cracks and door cracks, and when you are ready, turn
on the switch and go to sleep.</p>
<p>If you use propane to commit suicide, because propane is heavier than
air, you must lie down on the floor. On the contrary, gas is lighter
than air, so it is better to use it as high as possible. If you have the
courage to put a rubber tube in your mouth, that would be great.
Surprisingly, many people use this cutting-off technique. Kawabata
Yasunari<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>, also committed suicide in this
way. There are also examples of people who died by stuffing their heads
into a gas stove.</p>
<p>The method of covering the head with a plastic bag is foolproof as
long as it does not leak. It is also good to tie a rope around the
neck.</p>
<h3 id="note-beware-of-explosions">Note: Beware of explosions</h3>
<p>When committing suicide in a car, carbon monoxide is lighter than
air, so the gas sometimes leaks out through the window cracks. If you
are discovered during this period, or you may run out of gasoline, I
advise you to seal the window cracks tightly. Although death from
poisoning is less painful, headaches and nausea will persist if you do
not lose consciousness for a long time, so it is better to take sleeping
pills at the same time.</p>
<p>The man introduced the gas into the car, blocked the window cracks,
blocked the front window with a blanket so that no one could see inside,
and then took 60 sleeping pills. He was still awake and alerted the
police when he was discovered. Although he shouted “It’s within my
rights to die!”, he was still forcibly pulled out of the car. Not all
forms of suicide is a slow descent into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>When filling a room with gas, special attention must be paid to
explosions. Even the flash of a fluorescent lamp pointer can cause an
explosion. If a big explosion occurs, a huge amount of compensation will
have to be paid, and there are many cases where people are surrounded by
gas but do not die (Case study 18). You should pay attention to the
possibility of explosions, just like those people who first put up a
note “Turn off the gas switch, open the doors and windows to release the
gas, do not use electrical switches and matches due to the risk of
explosion.” to make others pay attention, before committing suicide by
gas.</p>
<p>When committing suicide with carbon monoxide poisoning in an
apartment, also be aware of those living upstairs. In 1976, a
20-year-old woman committed suicide by burning gas in her apartment. She
did not die, but a 21-year-old woman who was sleeping upstairs died of
carbon monoxide poisoning. This is because carbon monoxide is lighter
than air. However, the family members of the deceased pursued the
management responsibility of the suicide attempter’s parents, apartment
landlord, police and firefighting unit, and sued the court for 20.37
million yen in compensation. Indoor gas suicide should be recognized as
the easiest way to cause trouble to other people.</p>
<p>If rescued, suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, like hanging, will
damage the brain’s nerve tissue due to lack of oxygen, which may leave
serious sequelae for life. However, the often said phrase “leaving
serious lifelong sequelae” is not limited to gas suicides. Hanging,
jumping off a building, crashing a car, using drugs, etc., all suicide
methods are the same in this. If you want to commit suicide, you must
think of the consequences of failure.</p>
<h2 id="committing-suicide-by-burning-charcoal">(2) Committing suicide
by burning charcoal</h2>
<p>Prepare some charcoal and fire, seal yourself in a small space, light
the flame, watch the charcoal flame burn a little and then weaken,
gradually lose consciousness and then die. Although it is a bit
troublesome, the death is beautiful and easy. This suicide method is
mentioned in the novel <em>Le Juif Errant</em> (1844), written by the
French novelist Eugène Sue, so it is possible that people have committed
suicide by this method ever since charcoal was used by humans. The
principle of suicide by burning charcoal is the same as that of car gas
poisoning mentioned above.</p>
<p>Charcoal-burning suicide is widely spread in Hong Kong, and has
spread to mainland China, Taiwan, Japan and other places with the
Internet. While the composition of gas and other substances has changed
and is unsuitable for suicide, and other suicide methods are difficult
to implement, charcoal-burning suicide can be regarded as a simple
substitute.</p>
<h3
id="preparation-find-a-small-and-easily-enclosed-environment-sufficient-charcoal-firestarter-and-tape">Preparation
Find a small and easily enclosed environment, sufficient charcoal,
firestarter, and tape</h3>
<p>Most people who commit suicide by burning charcoal choose to commit
suicide in a single room at home or in a hotel, and the bathroom is
favored because of its small size. Generally speaking, there is
relatively less oxygen in a small space, and the carbon monoxide
concentration will reach lethal concentrations faster when burning
charcoal. Generally speaking, bathrooms, carriages and other places with
an area less than 6m2 are very suitable, but wooden structures should be
avoided as much as possible. On the one hand, wooden structures have
more gaps than concrete that are difficult to seal, and wooden
structures also increase the risk of fire.</p>
<p>Fire and charcoal should be the easiest to obtain among various
suicide tools. Generally speaking, machine-made charcoal and barbecue
charcoal are the best choices. They can be purchased in major shopping
malls such as Walmart. If you can’t find it, just go to the shops and
ask for barbecue equipment. For starting the fire, you can choose from
disposable lighters, matches, etc., but you may also need some paper,
gasoline or other things to light the charcoal.</p>
<p>Tape is used to seal the environment, but you can also use other
things for sealing. Close the doors and windows, and seal all door and
window gaps with tape. In the bathroom, be sure to block the exhaust fan
opening, and even the gap of the sewer drain, and all cracks in the
ceiling.</p>
<p>If possible, taking some alcohol or sleeping pills to put you to
sleep can help combat the pain of inhaling carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>Next, prepare the charcoal you bought, use your finally courage to
light it, and sit quietly and wait for death to come.</p>
<h3 id="note-fire-prevention-keep-a-sitting-posture">Note: Fire
prevention, keep a sitting posture</h3>
<p>Since you are lighting a fire to burn charcoal, there is bound to be
a risk of fire. If you are afraid of harming others, clear the
surrounding flammable materials before lighting a fire. Laying a
flame-retardant blanket on the ground or using a barbecue grill to burn
charcoal are also feasible methods.</p>
<p>Because carbon monoxide is less dense than air, carbon monoxide in
the air will tend to float upward. Only by staying seated can you ensure
that you inhale enough carbon monoxide.</p>
<h3 id="experience-very-little-pain">Experience: Very little pain</h3>
<p>As the concentration of carbon monoxide in the air increases,
breathing rhythm slows, dizziness and heartbeat increase, and soon the
person loses consciousness and dies. This is because hemoglobin, which
transports oxygen in the blood, combines with carbon monoxide at a
strength two hundred or even three hundred times that of oxygen, forming
CO-bound hemoglobin, which drastically reduces the oxygen supply to
cells in the body. When the concentration of carbon monoxide in the air
reaches 35 ppm, it will cause harm to the body.</p>

The curves from up to down are respectively: breathing, blood pressure,
pulse.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The concentration of carbon monoxide contained in car exhaust is
about 0.4 to 0.5%. When the proportion of CO-bound hemoglobin in the
blood reaches 30%, you will first feel dizziness, headache, collapse,
fatigue, and reduced judgment. When it reaches 40%, you will feel
nauseous, unable to do what you want to do, and feel tired. When it
reaches 50%, the skin turns red due to carbon monoxide and hemoglobin,
and the body temperature drops. When reaching 60%, shortness of breath,
absence of consciousness, incontinence, and convulsions may occur. When
reaching 70%, breathing stops and death occurs quickly (see Figure 2). A
person who commits suicide by poisoning in a car will fall unconscious
in about half an hour to an hour.</p>
<h3 id="for-the-most-beautiful-suicide-avoid-incontinence">For “the most
beautiful suicide”, avoid incontinence</h3>
<p>Among all the corpses of suicides, people say that the corpses of gas
suicides are “the most beautiful.” Your body will be found stained pink
because blood containing hemoglobin carbon monoxide gives the skin a
pink color. Clothes may become untied during cramps, but that’s okay.
However, incontinence often occurs in gas suicides. In the home of a man
who died from carbon monoxide poisoning in the bathroom, there was
faeces in the kitchen and on the bed. Since there was no feces in the
deceased’s rectum, we knew it was his. At that time, carbon monoxide was
accidentally produced by heating the bath water when there was no bath
water. He could not hold it in the kitchen or the bed, and then he went
to the bathroom and died. Generally, incontinence occurs even when
someone is conscious. Anyone who wants to see a clean body must go to
the toilet beforehand.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-18-man-sentenced-for-gas-suicide-attempt">Case study
18: Man sentenced for gas suicide attempt</h2>
<p>In April 1978, a 47-year-old unemployed man who lived in a townhouse
in Fukuoka Prefecture attempted to commit suicide by using gas. At
around 10 a.m., he fell into hallucinatory symptoms of stimulant
poisoning. He was distressed because his mistress had left and thought
of committing suicide. He pulled a rubber hose from a propane barrel
outside the house to the bathroom, filling the room with gas. But he
didn’t die after a long time. Two hours later, when he wanted to smoke
and lit a lighter, the gas exploded. The explosion caused a total of
12.4 million yen in damage to the 28 households living in the town
house, and injured nine residents. He himself was hospitalized for a
month to treat burns.</p>
<p>He was charged with the crime of “gas leakage”, and in February of
the following year, the Iizuka Branch of the Fukuoka District Court
sentenced him to 8 months in prison for the crime of “injuring multiple
people and causing serious consequences.”</p>
<h3 id="check-this-example-10">Check: this example</h3>
<p>This is an example of someone who chooses to commit suicide by using
a gas explosion, but since the attempt failed and caused damage to the
surrounding area, he was be charged with the crime of “gas leakage”.</p>
<p>Article 118, Paragraph 1 of the Japanese Criminal Code stipulates:
“Anyone who causes danger to human life, body or property by leaking or
flowing out or blocking gas, electricity or steam shall be sentenced to
imprisonment of not more than three years and a fine of not more than
100,000 yen fine.”</p>
<p>A similar example is that in 1976, a 28-year-old company manager in
an apartment in Osaka also attempted suicide by using gas indoors,
resulting in a big explosion. One apartment was burned down and about 70
others were injured. He prosecuted for the crime of “gas leakage” and
“fire from gross negligence”. Even if he is a suicide attempter, he
cannot escape legal responsibility.</p>
<p>From the above examples, we can also know that the propane explosion
that filled the house for two hours may not have killed anyone, yet it
damaged to 28 households, and yet he only suffered injuries that
required treatment for a month. The contrast between the lack of
personal death and the great property damage is curious.</p>
<p>When the room was full of gas and he was about to die, he lit the
lighter because he wanted to smoke. It seemed that he was a fool, but in
fact there were many such ridiculous things in this world.</p>
<h2
id="case-study-19-a-man-who-committed-suicide-according-to-a-french-suicide-manual">Case
study 19: A man who committed suicide according to a French suicide
manual</h2>
<p>In July 1983, a strange man (46 years old at the time) wearing
swimming trunks and immersed in the cold water of the bathtub, with a
black plastic garbage bag on his head and a rope around his neck tied to
the window sill. The body was discovered. Empty bags containing 40
tablets of the analgesic “SEDES” were found in the apartment where he
died. It seems that he took the medicine and then committed suicide in
this way. At the same time, I also found the instruction manual
<em>Suicide - the most comfortable ways to die</em> published in Japan
in the same year in the room<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>, and clipped a tape to
the reference page. On page 184, four combinations of suicide methods
that can lead to euthanasia are introduced: “1. Suffocation with
analgesics and plastic bags; 2. Poisoning caused by large amounts of
drugs that can reach poisoning levels and car exhaust gases; 3.
Analgesics and hypothermia (long-term immersion in cold water); 4.
Analgesics and drowning.” He committed suicide by choosing a combination
of one and three.</p>
<p>He was a salesman at Korakuen Stadium, the predecessor of Tokyo
Indoor Stadium. He disappeared a year ago. Later, he left his wife and
children and lived as an alcoholic man in a small room. The reason for
his disappearance is said to be that he ran away after being chased by
his creditors after being in debt.</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-6">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>Suicide by suffocation with a plastic bag is painful, but very simple
like this. The analgesic “SEDES”<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> cannot reach a lethal
dose, but the effect of the drug and the hypothermia caused by cold
water are useful in reducing the respiratory function.</p>
<p>The role of suicide manuals cannot be ignored. The original book was
published in France in 1982. Soon six people were affected and committed
suicide. Therefore, it caused a great response and became a best-selling
manual. The part this person refers to comes from the manual issued by
the “British Euthanasia Association” on membership restrictions, so the
description is correct. Needless to say, this book also draws on some
material from that book.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that he specifically put a tape on so that
others could understand that he was “going to die after watching this.”
There are also people in France who committed suicide by taking poison
after opening the pages of the reference book. The intention of trying
to attract the attention of the world through this method is very
clear.</p>
<h2
id="case-study-20-the-rōnin-studentronin-student-who-used-a-plastic-bag-to-conduct-a-suicide-experiment">Case
study 20: The rōnin student<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> who used a plastic bag
to conduct a suicide experiment</h2>
<p>In November 1974, an 18-year-old man was found in Kawasaki City. He
had suffocated to death in bed with a plastic bag covering his nose and
mouth, and then with a rubber band. There are two pieces of 400-word
manuscript paper on the desk, which contain the results of testing
various suicide methods, with the title “Under Experiment”. It can be
seen from this that the young man put a plastic bag over his mouth and
suffocated to death during a suicide experiment.</p>
<p>His notes are as follows: “(1) 15 minutes after the experiment
started, breathing accelerated and hands and feet were numb. 25 minutes
later, the whole body was paralyzed, breathing tripled, and heartbeat
120 times. You can survive for 30 minutes if you stay still in bed. (2)
Brain disorder occurs in about one hour, and death occurs in about two
hours. Before that, the plastic bag should be removed and the heart
should be massaged.”</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-7">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>It seems that someone who commits suicide with a plastic bag goes
through the sequence of “suffocation -&gt; numbness of hands and feet
-&gt; general paralysis -&gt; rapid heartbeat -&gt; loss of
consciousness” and so on until death. So, why didn’t he take off the
plastic bag? The possible reasons are: (1) When he was about to
suffocate, he hurriedly wanted to take it off, but in his hurry, he
unexpectedly fell unconscious quickly. (2) As he slowly loses
consciousness, his body becomes paralyzed, and he could not take it
off.</p>
<p>If item (2) is correct, then though we have always written that
suicide by suffocation is painful, but in fact it might be a quite
comfortable method. However, this feeling about dying cannot be tested
and can only be known by doctors’ speculation. Therefore, these “death
experiments” are also extremely valuable information in medicine.</p>

<p>Gentler than generally imagined. The disadvantages are: a few seconds
of electric shock, and the trouble of stripping the skin off the
wires.</p>
<p>Statistics from Japan’s Ministry of Health and Welfare in 1991 show
that among the 19,875 suicides that year, 56 used electrocution, which
was the least popular method of suicide. Moreover, the strange thing is
that 53 of them were men, accounting for 95% of the total. It can be
said that it is a suicide method used almost exclusively by men. It is
not because the overall number is low. Even among the statistics of more
than 100 people, more than 90% are men. Some people say that it may be
because women are particularly afraid of electricity.</p>
<p>Death by electrocution is caused by instantaneous respiratory
cessation, cardiac arrest, shock, etc. The pain is really only
momentary. One doctor said that suicide by electrocution is one of the
comfortable ways to die.</p>
<p>The method is very simple. Peel off one end of the wire to expose the
copper wire, plug it in and touch it to your chest or back. For those
who are impulsive and want to die, this is the best method. The
disadvantage is that there are many attempts, but there are no special
sequelae, so it is a good method that you may want to give it another
thought.</p>

<p>Sneaking into the substation to touch the high-voltage current part
is the easiest way, but it is scary after all. Or connect a wire in your
house, stick the two terminals on your body, put on a timer and go to
sleep. One copper wire is attached to the chest, and the other is
attached to the back. If you don’t want to attach it to the chest, you
can attach it to both wrists. A 16-year-old female high school student
committed suicide by wrapping a wire around her right thumb and sticking
the other wire to her vest. But to do this, the wire should preferably
be wrapped around the left thumb, which is closer to the heart. There is
also a nuclear scientist who puts one end of the electrode in his mouth
and inserts the other end into his anus to commit suicide using a timer.
However, how he fell asleep without letting the copper wire fall out of
his mouth is still a mystery. Better not imitate this.</p>
<p>Just tape down the copper wire. Wet the part in contact with the
body, the resistance will be less, and the effect will be better. Under
normal circumstances, the resistance is also a factor that reduces the
accuracy. You might as well use wet absorbent cotton or gauze to hold it
down from above. You can use salt water when wetting absorbent cotton.
If you can get some ointment used for electrocardiograms, the resistance
will be less. There are also examples of using 10-yen coins as
conductors. Of course, wrapping both copper wires around the chest is
the most reliable method. Regardless, the important thing is to keep the
heart in the path of the electric current. Use a transformer to increase
the voltage, and the lethality will be even higher.</p>
<p>Not many people can still sleep soundly in this situation, so drink
some alcohol. Set the timer for the deepest sleeping time, about two
hours after going to bed. There are many examples of setting the time at
three o’clock in the morning, so this should be the reason. In short, it
is most important to reduce the resistance as much as possible and
increase the voltage.</p>
<p>Throwing a running electric heater or electric razor into the bathtub
while bathing will also conduct electricity, but the reliability is
extremely low. If you have to do it, then improve the conductivity by
adding some salt to the hot water.</p>
<h2 id="experience-a-moment-of-bone-chilling-pain">Experience: A moment
of bone-chilling pain</h2>
<p>The biggest question here is what is the person’s consciousness like
at the moment when the current passes through? Using a timer, if it goes
smoothly according to the predetermined plan, a hundred volts of current
will pass through the body a few hours after you fall asleep. It causes
the heart to contract immediately, and after a few seconds, the patient
loses consciousness, stops blood circulation in the heart, and dies.
According to a doctor’s observation: Under normal conditions, there will
be instant bone-chilling pain. Muscle relaxants are difficult to obtain,
so you will inevitably experience muscle spasms. For example, drinking a
lot of alcohol or taking sleeping pills can make you confused and
confused during sleep, then die peacefully. Although one may lost
consciousness at this time, one’s whole body would twitch. There is
another way of saying: Losing consciousness only takes a few seconds or
an instant, but it takes about three minutes until the heart stops
beating.</p>
<p>A man who regained consciousness after being electrocuted said this
about the “moment”: “Suddenly I felt controlled by a force and fell
unconscious.”</p>
<p>So, will it trip the wire when the current passes the body? The power
company believes that “this situation is not impossible.” A coroner
said: “So far there doesn’t seem to have been a case where a wire-trip
has occurred.” So, there seems to be no need to worry about this.</p>
<p>Since there are death row prisoners who did not die immediately after
sitting on the 2,000-volt electric chair, is the 100-volt voltage in the
home enough? Some people may feel uneasy. However, it’s not always the
case that the higher the voltage, the more lethal.</p>
<p>The resistance of human skin is 1000 to 2000 ohm in a dry state
(women have lower impedance than men). The maximum current intensity
that can pass through the body in this state is only 100 milliamps. This
intensity is the smallest current that can cause ventricular
fibrillation, which can stop the heart. Of course, if the skin is wet,
the resistance can be reduced by one-tenth. In fact, in low-voltage
situations, weak currents can easily cause ventricular fibrillation for
the heart, which is actually dangerous. In addition, the most dangerous
frequency to the human body is 50 to 60 Hz, which is consistent with the
frequency of household current. AC power from the socket is more likely
to cause ventricular fibrillation than DC power. This means that if
electricity is applied to the heart within three seconds of ventricular
fibrillation, a household voltage of 100 volts can completely
electrocute a person.</p>
<p>Electrocution in a bathtub, the cause of death was cardiac arrest or
shock. Applying electricity to the brain will paralyze the respiratory
center and cause breathing to stop, but this is rare.</p>
<h2 id="corpse-appearance-almost-no-damage">Corpse appearance: Almost no
damage</h2>
<p>The parts touched by the electrodes will leave burn marks, but the
body will be almost undamaged. The resistance of the skin is low, and
sometimes there are no traces of burns. As if in a state of sleep, this
is one of the methods that can leave a (relatively speaking) beautiful
corpse.</p>
<h2 id="note-aim-for-the-heart">Note: Aim for the heart</h2>
<p>The target is the heart. If you really want to die, other parts won’t
work. Be sure to try to get the current through the heart. If you want
to use a timer to die in your sleep, don’t forget to secure the copper
wire firmly to prevent it from falling off in the blanket. Even if it is
wrapped around your body, it will not achieve the purpose if it falls
off during sleep.</p>
<p>Even when the person is dead, there would still be an electric
current in the body. There is a risk of someone coming over to touch the
body and getting an electric shock, so be careful, but there is nothing
a suicide can do about this. If you don’t want to cause trouble to
others, then put a note saying “Don’t touch, it’s dangerous!”</p>
<h2
id="case-study-21-electrocution-in-the-restroom-of-a-racecourse">Case
study 21: Electrocution in the restroom of a racecourse</h2>
<p>At six o’clock in the afternoon on an April day in 1981, the body of
a man about 50 years old, 160 cm tall, and with an athlete’s hairstyle
was found at the Nakayama Racecourse in Funabashi, two hours after the
end of the last race of the day. He had connected the wire to the
ventilation fan in the toilet and taped the other end to his chest. He
was electrocuted and died. His body was already in rigor mortis when he
was found. The deceased was wearing a new three-piece suit, a freshly
starched blue straight shirt, a blue tie with white spots, a
straw-yellow windbreaker, and short black leather boots. He was quite
neat. He only had 8,350 yen in cash, short HOPE cigarettes, a 100-yen
lighter, and a horse racing newspaper with a suicide note, but the
identity of the deceased was never revealed.</p>
<p>He wrote a suicide note written in red pen on the newspaper: “I’m
stupid. I failed in life because of horses. I’m sorry! A stupid person.
I’m really sorry, I’m too tired!”</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-8">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>This is a good example of how easy it is to commit suicide by
electrocution. He probably exposed the copper wire and put it on his
chest, then inserted the plug into the socket and his heart was
energized, causing cardiac arrest. The famous saying in the suicide
note, “Life fails for the sake of horses,” was used as a headline in the
social section of the newspaper the next day to report the incident.</p>
<h1 id="map_4">Map 4: Kumatori serial suicide case</h1>
<p>Between June and July 1992, a total of five men and women committed
suicide every week in Kumatori, Osaka. The first to die was the
unemployed boy A (17 years old). It was discovered on June 4th
(Thursday). Then on the 10th (Wednesday) Mr. B (18 years old) from the
construction industry, on the 17th (Wednesday) the hotel clerk Mr. C (18
years old), and on the 25th (Thursday) Mr. D (22 years old), a civil
servant from the neighboring city, hanged himself. suicide. On July 2
(Thursday), E, ​​a female student at Machuchi Sports University, stabbed
herself three times in the chest and committed suicide.</p>
<p>Somehow, all of them died on Wednesday or Thursday. The places of
suicide are also extremely close, concentrated within a radius of 500
meters. In addition, the first three people were all members of a group
of delinquents who formed a Bōsōzoku (Japanese biker gang) a year ago.
The motive for all members’ suicides is completely unknown. This series
of suicides with unknown motives shocked the whole of Japan. Its level
of mystery is comparable to the “Death Guide” incident on Mount Mihara
in the history of suicide in Japan.</p>
<p>In the local area, most people believe it was serial homicide. If it
is so, it means that there is a murderer who kills one person every week
and kills five people in total. When this kind of weird suicide occurs,
it will inevitably lead to the theory of homicide. However, it’s best
not to believe too much.</p>

<h2 id="place-of-death">Place of death</h2>
<p>The population is said to be less than 40,000, but Kumatori is not a
rural town. There is a large bus station building in front of the
station, and the commercial street is frequently visited by pedestrians.
However, if you take a taxi from the station at the west end of the town
and drive east along National Route 170 for ten minutes, you will see
the existing rural land on the right. Around here, five people committed
suicide. Get out and walk around here. There are woods and farm huts
everywhere. The place of suicide is your choice.</p>
<p>Check the place of death of the serial suicide beforehand. It may be
a good idea to remember the old friend and think of dying serially. The
onion hut and small warehouse where Mr. A and Mr. B committed suicide
have been demolished. The chestnut tree where Mr. D hanged himself has
also been cut down. Only the farm work hut where Mr. C hanged himself is
still there. Summer is also a bit spooky, and a hut with a few beams on
the roof is the best place to commit suicide. The location of the
suicide scene is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<h2 id="suicide-method">Suicide method</h2>
<p>If you want to commit suicide in this town, there is no other option
but to hang yourself. When hanging, it is better to use a rope to suit
the surrounding atmosphere. It is also interesting to tie yourself
behind your back and hang yourself, then lower the rope from a high
place to imitate the mystery of serial suicides.<a href="#fn49"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a>
Perhaps the theory of homicide would rise again in the local area, and
maybe you have become a prominent figure in the public media. It is best
to not leave a suicide note, to enhance the mystery.</p>
<h2 id="transportation-and-accommodation-2">Transportation and
accommodation</h2>
<p>From Osaka, take the JR Loop Line to East Tennoji station, then
transfer to the Hanwa Line, which will take you to Kumatoricho Station
in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>There are no accommodation facilities in Kumatori. If you arrive at
night, or plan to rest for a night before committing suicide, you can go
to HOTEL NEWyutaka in Izumisano City, which is only five minutes away
from the station. This is a recently built high-end hotel with a nice
interior decoration. Single rooms are 6,800 yen and double rooms are
14,000 yen, which are reasonable prices.</p>
<p>If you arrive in Kumatori rashly, you will be confused about the
geographical environment. It is best to arrive the day before, check the
environment in advance, stay in this hotel, carefully plan the method
and decide the location, and then commit suicide the next day.</p>

<p>It can be done anywhere as long as there is water. But the moment of
suffocation was painful, and the death was miserable. Taken together, it
is not a very good way to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Do some people mistakenly believe that people who are good at
swimming will not commit suicide by throwing themselves into the water?
No matter how good your swimming skills are, you will still drown
inexplicably due to “certain effects” that will be explained below. So
far, many master swimmers have drowned.</p>
<p>Suicide by drowning is mainly caused by suffocation. Because you have
to experience difficulty breathing and suffocation for a few seconds, it
cannot be considered a comfortable suicide. Despite this, this ancient
and interesting method of suicide has been used both at home and abroad
in ancient and modern times. This can also be known from the use of
ancient Greek female poets. Now in Japan, the elderly and women are
particularly fond of this method. Overall, the utilization rate has
declined, but statistics by adoption method every year show that it is
still in the top five. The success rate is also as high as 80%, no
wonder it is very attractive.</p>
<p>Basically, drowning or drowning is not limited to seas, lakes,
rivers, and ponds. It can be done anywhere as long as there is “water”.
There is no need to immerse the whole body in the water. There are many
people who drowned in ditches after being drunk. There are even
“mountain drowners” who died drunkenly on a mountain trail when a heavy
rain filled their lungs with water. There are also examples of people
committing suicide by putting their heads in a washbasin or washing
machine. In Tamagawa Aqueduct, famous for being the spot where the
writer Osamu Dazai and his mistress Tomie Yamazaki suicided together by
drowning in 1948, a member of the Self-Defense Force drowned in a place
with a depth of only 40 centimeters.</p>
<h2 id="preparation-3">Preparation</h2>
<h3 id="bind-the-body">Bind the body</h3>
<p>The practice of binding the body is a bit primitive, but it is a very
effective method. If you tie your feet and hands behind your back and
jump into the water, you will drown regardless of whether you are a good
swimmer or not. (Of course, even in this case, a smarter person can
still float on his back.) However, it is difficult for a person to tie
his hands and feet alone. Here is a method that anyone can do. First tie
your feet, then tie your left hand (dominant hand or opposite hand) to
your left thigh and jump in. If you row the boat into the deep sea or
the center of a lake and jump in, it will sink quickly. At this time,
putting rocks or other things in your pocket can speed up drowning. If
you feel tired after drinking alcohol, you will easily lose your sense
of balance. This is very reliable. Taking a large amount of sleeping
pills is even more reliable.</p>
<p>If you want to die simply and conveniently, then drive the car into
the water. As long as you don’t try to climb out of the car, you will
not be saved.</p>
<p>The easier way is to take a large passenger ship and jump into the
water halfway, then you will be dragged down by the whirlpool stirred up
by the ship. It is said that half of the corpses recovered in the Seto
Inland Sea were due to this.</p>
<p>As a place to jump or launch, the sea and lake are more ideal. When
choosing, you should choose a coast with few people and fast lakes. Of
course, choose the time at night when it is not easy to be
discovered.</p>
<h3 id="also-ok-in-the-bathroom">Also OK in the bathroom</h3>
<p>Dying in the bathroom is also very easy. Fill the bathtub with water,
tie your feet, then lie down with your hands tied behind your back and
put your head into the water. A certain housewife successfully committed
suicide using this method.</p>
<p>A more special method is to fill a fixed gasoline barrel with water.
If the water enters the head, you will be unable to escape and
drown.</p>
<p>In addition, as a particularly suitable place to drown, it is
Naruto’s whirlpool in the Seto Inland Sea. You may be pushed out when
you swim toward the whirlpool, but once you are caught in the whirlpool,
you will never be able to get out. The fatality rate is 100%.</p>
<p>The best season is winter. When the water temperature is low, people
may die from shock or cause heart paralysis, and fatigue will appear
quickly, so they can die peacefully. That is to say, there are cases
where death is caused not by drowning but by “hypothermia”, that is,
freezing. If you want to freeze to death, you must drink some wine or
sleeping pills.</p>
<h2 id="experience-this-is-how-a-master-swimmer-drowns">Experience: This
is how a master swimmer drowns</h2>
<p>Now let’s describe how a swimmer can die by drowning.</p>
<p>It is best to set out at night. If you keep swimming forward, you
will follow the current and swim to the deep sea. It doesn’t take long
for you to get tired, but you can’t stop. The waves in the open sea were
very big, so you’d drink more water, and the water in the trachea would
cause severe choking. In the process of repeatedly drinking, spitting,
and choking water, water also enters the ear tube connecting the mouth
and ears. This is the key. Some people say: “The ears have tympanic
membranes, and water should flow into the three semicircular canals.”
But the water still flows in from the mouth.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/8_1.png" alt="Figure 1: The stages of drowning." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 1: The stages of
drowning.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 1 shows the stages of drowning. First, due to the sudden
stimulation of the skin, the person will take a deep breath (Phase 1),
and then the breathing will stop for 30 seconds to 1 minute (Phase 2).
Soon after, due to the increase in carbon dioxide in the blood, there
will be intense spasmodic inhalation and expiration for 1 to 3 minutes
(stage 3), followed by loss of consciousness for about 1 minute (stage
4), and sinking and death (stage 5). (Excerpted from <em>Small Forensic
Medicine Book</em>, published by Kinpodo Publishing)</p>
<p>The water flowing into the ear canal causes piston movement and
causes bleeding in the parts covering the three semicircular canals,
causing dysfunction of the three semicircular canals through acute poor
circulation. If this function is damaged, the sense of balance will be
lost, and it will be difficult to distinguish up and down, left, and
right. The more you try to inhale, the more water will enter your
trachea, causing your throat to spasm. Eventually, you will stop
breathing, lose consciousness, and sink to the bottom of the water.</p>
<p>This is generally how it happens when a swimmer drowns. The process
of reaching unconsciousness is mostly caused not by suffocation from
drinking a lot of water, but by inhaling water into the trachea while
choking. In this case, even if you are a good swimmer, you can be
confident in committing suicide by drowning. And some people say that
when they are about to lose consciousness, past memories will emerge as
clearly as lightning, just like the wonderful experiences introduced in
the chapters on <a href="#chapter_2">hanging</a> and <a
href="#chapter_3">leaping</a>.</p>
<p>After losing consciousness, you first exhale water, and then inhale
water into lungs. Breathing stops and you die. It takes about one to
three minutes from the onset of coughing to loss of consciousness. I was
told that death occurs after four to five minutes for fresh water, eight
to twelve minutes for sea water, and twenty minutes to half an hour for
cardiac arrest.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> Having said that, it is difficult
to save someone who has been in the water for more than two minutes.</p>

appearance: Can you be Laura Palmer?<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a></h2>
<p>The corpse may surface a few days later. Its body and face would be
so swollen that even its parents could not recognize it (professionals
described it as “giant-like”<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>). The skin would be
peeling off and the scrotum swollen like balloons, with moss growing on
the body. There would be some shark bites and ship propellers cuts. The
flesh would look like they had been nibbled by fish, crabs, etc.</p>
<p>Of the corpses that had once sunken to the bottom of the water, 20 to
30% would soon surface. Bodies, once retrieved from the water back to
the land, will spit out a large number of small bubbles from their
mouths and noses. If the body does not float up quickly, it will take
two or three days in summer and two or three months in winter because of
the putrefactive gas produced in the body (see Figure 2). The buoyancy
of putrefactive gas is so great that there was once a corpse tied with a
weight of nearly ten kilograms that floated to the surface anyway.
However, when the sinking depth reaches more than 30 to 40 meters, due
to the low temperature of the water, the putrefactive gas cannot
accumulate, and the water pressure compresses the gas, so most of the
corpses will not float up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Cape Ashizuri, the southernmost tip of Shikoku, is a
popular suicide spot where the body will never float. Those who refuse
to have their corpses discovered may wish to choose a place with deep
water, such as Cape Ashizuri.</p>

can’t swim are at an advantage</h2>
<p>When you plunge into the sea or lakes, be sure not to be seen.
Especially when jumping into the sea, it will cause them to dispatch
expensive coastal rescue troops.</p>
<p>People who can swim may also commit suicide in this way, but it is
undeniable that this method is more for those who cannot swim and the
elderly. In fact, men in their 20s and 30s rarely commit suicide by
drowning. Even if you make up your mind and jump into the water, you
still have to swim a few times, and there are many cases of being
rescued during the splash. People who can swim better choose other
methods.</p>
<h2

study 22: The actress who buried her head in the toilet and drowned</h2>
<p>In 1944, Lupe Vélez, a has-been Hollywood star, drowned her head in
the toilet.</p>
<p>She was born María Vélez, in Mexico, in 1908. She longed to be a
famous actress. When she was ten years old, she left Mexico City and
came to Hollywood, where she played the heroine in the movie <em>The
Gaucho</em> (1927). Later, she climbed to the pinnacle of Hollywood
fame, dated many famous actors, and lived a luxurious life. Due to her
willful and jealous character, there were divorces and scandals. Because
of these scandals, her reputation declined, and soon she fell to the
level of R-rated comedy movies. But unable to forget her past glory, she
took on debts that were difficult to repay and lived a luxurious life.
In the end, she became pregnant with the child of Harald Ramond, a young
Austrian actor, and was asked to abort it. She was extremely frustrated
and, as described in her suicide note, “I prefer to take my life away
and our baby’s, before I bring him with shame or killing him. How could
you Harald, fake such great love for me and our baby when all the time
you didn’t want us. I see no other way out for me, so goodbye and good
luck to you.”</p>
<p>She decided to commit suicide and invited many friends to attend the
luxurious banquet with dozens of large candles, which she held with
borrowed money. She took a handful of sleeping pills and slept in bed
that night. However, she vomited in the middle of the night and was
unable to breathe. In extreme pain, she crawled to the bathroom, stuck
her face into the toilet and drowned.</p>
<p>Having become a corpse, she no longer looks like the screen beauty
she once was, but her face is peaceful. She once said her best friend,
Estelle Taylor, “People think I like to fight. I have to fight for
everything. I’m so tired of it all. Ever since I was a baby I’ve been
fighting.”</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-9">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>A small amount of water in the toilet can kill someone. This is an
example that proves that people can drown anywhere. At the same time,
this example also allows us to see a typical failure example of suicide
with drugs. Even so, it seems very extreme for a depressed actress to
end her life in the toilet.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-23-near-death-experience-before-drowning">Case study
23: Near-death experience before drowning</h2>
<p>A seventeen-year-old American girl went swimming in the lake with her
brother one day. There were many young people swimming in the lake.
Someone shouted: “Swim to the other side!”, so everyone started to swim
to the other side. The girl had made the crossing several times before,
but this time she nearly drowned.</p>
<p>The girl was rescued, and later she talked about the experience: “I
was half-sinking and half-floating. Suddenly I felt like I was separated
from my body, sitting alone in a void. I was there, motionless, but my
body was floating in the water three or four feet in front of me. I saw
my body from the right side and from behind. Even though my body was
some distance away, I still felt that I had a complete body. My body… I
felt very relaxed, as if I had turned into a feather.”</p>
<h3 id="check-this-example-11">Check: this example</h3>
<p>It’s not a suicide, but it talks about a near-death experience that
happens when one is about to drown. This situation is a relaxing
experience when one’s consciousness separates from the body and watches
one’s own soul escape and the body become like a feather. Moreover, it
is worth noting that no matter how many times an expert swimmer has
crossed the lake, he sometimes drowns “for unknown reasons”<a

<p>Has the strongest impact on others, can definitely kill you, and it
can also burn your name into the history books. However, the pain is
also the most intense and the death is miserable. There are many cases
where people with 100% skin burns did not die immediately and were sent
to the hospital, where they struggled for a long time before dying. The
consequences of not dying are more tragic than any other means of
suicide. For those who want to die an ordinary death, I will never
advise them to adopt this method. However, if you want to accuse this
society of something with your death, there is no way more dramatic than
self-immolation. Thích Quảng Đức, the Vietnamese monk who protested the
government in the Vietnam War, the students who recently committed
suicide for the anti-government movement in South Korea,<a href="#fn54"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>
and the cadre of the Kamagasaki Joint Struggle Committee in Japan who
fought to improve the treatment of the grassroots working class,<a
href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> they all committed suicide by
self-immolation and caught the attention of society. Yes, the image of
being surrounded by flames and shouting his opinions is very
influential.</p>
<p>There is nothing better than using self-immolation to express strong
will and determination to die. The seven female believers who committed
mass suicide following the late leader of the “Friends of Truth”<a
href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> in 1986 also committed suicide by
setting themselves on fire.</p>
<p>Some people may think that not too many people commit suicide by
self-immolation, but the number is increasing every year. Currently,
there are about 700 people a year, which is much more than committing
suicide by electrocution. According to current medical diagnosis
standards, one-third of all suicides are considered to be mentally ill
in the “narrow sense”, and the majority of those who attempt
self-immolation are considered to be mentally ill.</p>
<h2 id="preparation-five-liters-should-be-enough">Preparation: Five
liters should be enough</h2>
<p>Needless to say, this method requires gasoline or kerosene, but how
many liters?</p>
<p>Burning 20% ​​of the skin on the whole body would already be a lot for
the body to take, but in order to die for certain, the only way is to
pour gasoline all over the body. Although there are examples of using
two or three liters of kerosene to completely burn off the skin, for the
sake of safety, it is better to prepare at least five liters.</p>
<p>Gasoline and kerosene can be poured on little by little, and the
clothes would soak in to be fully flammable. If kerosene gets into your
eyes, it will be very painful and you will be unable to open them.
However, if you would be bothered by this consideration, you are
definitely not the kind of person who can commit suicide by
self-immolation.</p>
<p>If you are afraid of starting a fire, you can put down a
flame-retardant carpet so that even if you lie down and burn indoors, it
will not cause a fire. There was also a 48-year-old housewife who doused
her in gasoline and went inside an incinerator, but this was totally
unnecessary, and only became good gossip material for <em>Women’s
Weekly</em> magazine.</p>
<p>After dousing yourself with gasoline, you can use a lighter or a
match to light the fire of destiny. Anyone planning to make a statement
should have it firmly in mind beforehand, lest they panic and forget it
all.</p>
<p>There are also many people who pour gasoline indoors and burn the
entire house down. But this method is strictly worse than the others. If
you are going to suffer the extreme agony of burning to death, you
should let people see that it is you who are burning. Having others see
you burn is the entire point of self-immolation.</p>
<h2 id="the-process-a-three-meter-high-pillar-of-fire-emerges">The
process: A three-meter-high pillar of fire emerges</h2>
<p>The flames is much stronger than one imagines. Once gasoline or
kerosene is ignited, it will make a sound and suddenly burst into flames
two to three meters high. The body shrouded in flames will experience
severe pain and burning sensation, and will roll on the ground because
it is unbearable. There will be a stink of burning human flesh all
around. But generally the perception is still clear. The trachea was
burned due to inhalation of hot air, but the sound could still come out.
After the clothes were completely burned, the fire was extinguished, but
some people could still stand there on their own and continue to shout
(Case study 24).</p>
<p>After the fire is out, if more than one-third of the skin is
necrotic, nearly half of the people will die. If more than two-thirds of
the skin is necrotic, almost all people will die without exception. The
time of death varies. If the skin of the whole body is burned as black
as charcoal, the person will die on the spot. After the fire is
extinguished, they will be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. The
body cannot move, so they will greet the arrival of death in pain. .
Some finally breathed their last after half a day or one day, or even
five or ten days. An 82-year-old American woman who set herself on fire
while shouting “against the Vietnam War” lived consciously for ten days.
Her problem was probably caused by alcohol-based detergent that didn’t
burn well.</p>
<p>Causes of death caused by self-immolation include shock, hypoxia, and
thermal coagulation of vital organs.</p>
<h2 id="corpse-appearance-the-skin-was-torn-and-bloody">Corpse
appearance: The skin was torn and bloody</h2>
<p>The corpse would be in a miserable condition, second only to suicide
by lying on the railway.</p>
<p>Pouring more than five liters of gasoline and lighting it on fire.
When no one puts out the fire, part or all of the skin surface will be
carbonized and all the hair will be burned out. The skin peeled off,
revealing red flesh. Originally, the human body is basically made of
water, so even if the skin is carbonized, the meat is difficult to burn.
The characteristic of this posture is that it becomes a boxing posture
due to muscle contraction. Blisters appear on the skin that has not yet
become necrotic, and the color changes from yellow to brown, and finally
to black. The corneas are white and turbid, and the tongue is often
stuck out.</p>
<h2 id="note-dont-fall-into-the-keloidal-hell">Note: Don’t fall into the
keloidal hell</h2>
<p>The most terrifying thing is to leave a life behind, but continue to
live with burn marks on the face or body.</p>
<p>A woman poured kerosene all over her body and lit a match but failed
to commit suicide. After three years of living in a hospital bed, her
body was covered with keloids. Even though she underwent five plastic
surgeries, the keloids were not eliminated. She had no lips and could
not open her mouth wide. Moreover, compared with other methods, where
people who have attempted suicide would attempt again, self-immolation
suicide attempters typically do not attempt suicide again. The may be
because they have recovered from the near-death state by using extreme
methods and have gained emotional balance. Still, the skin
transplantation will cost a huge amount of money. In order not to get to
this point, pour at least five liters of gasoline. If someone comes to
put out the fire, shout: “Don’t come close!” Even so, if you are still
worried about the attempt, you can use it together with other
methods.</p>
<p>A man killed a woman who cheated on him (24 years old), ran to the
top of the tenth floor of his alma mater university, doused himself with
gasoline and jumped off the building. However, there is absolutely no
need to try this hard. Self-immolation is already a very lethal
method.</p>
<p>All in all, self-immolation is painful. But remember, death won’t
happen immediately. Everyone has their own preferred method of death. If
one wants to die quietly, I would suggest another method. However, if
you think you have lived as a nobody but want to die as somebody, then
that’s up to you.</p>

id="case-study-24-korean-youth-who-set-himself-on-fire-to-demand-better-working-conditions">Case
study 24: Korean youth who set himself on fire to demand better working
conditions</h2>
<p>In November 1970, Jeon Tae-il (전태일), a young tailor (then 22 years
old) who was working under poor working conditions, set himself on fire
in Seoul Peace Market (서울평화시장; Seoul Pyeonghwa Sijang), demanding
better working conditions.</p>
<p>Before that, he had been engaged in a movement to improve labor
conditions, but suffered setbacks. Finally, on November 3, he forcibly
launched a demonstration – which he applied for, but could not get
permission for – in the Seoul Peace Market. When the workers were
participating in the demonstration, the guards, and the police When
there was a fierce conflict between the troops, he appeared in the
market later than his companions and asked his companions to “light a
match and throw it at me.” When the match was thrown on him, his whole
body immediately became a pillar of fire, then a ball of fire. He
breathed the flames and squeezed into the crowd, shouting: “Abide by the
Basic Labor Law! We are not machines! Give me back my Sunday! Oppose the
cruel driving of workers!”, and finally fell down with a scream. But he
stood up with difficulty and shouted: “Don’t let me die in vain!”. His
eyes and nose were burned and blurred. He fell unconscious and his
companions put out the fire three minutes later. After being sent to the
medical center, he muttered: “I’m a little hungry!” Nine hours later, at
around 10 o’clock in the evening, he died.</p>
<p>His suicide by self-immolation was later named the “Manifesto of
Humanity”, which is still circulated today.</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-10">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>Although the fire was extinguished three minutes after losing
consciousness, and he died from severe burns nine hours later, it was
possible to scream continuously, and as long as he had the strength to
fall down once, he could still stand up and shout. Of course, it varies
from person to person. When he turned into a ball of fire, though he
stumbled around due to the heat, he was otherwise very conscious.</p>
<p>This can be said to be the most effective example of self-immolation
and suicide. His suicide did have a great effect, and it fulfilled his
wish for him who died.</p>
<h2
id="case-study-25-a-middle-school-girl-who-burned-herself-because-of-incest">Case
study 25: A middle school girl who burned herself because of incest</h2>
<p>A twelve-year-old middle school girl committed suicide by setting
herself on fire in the yard of her uncle’s house. Her parents divorced
shortly after she was born and she lost her mother. She was raised by
her grandmother. Due to her father’s work, she transferred to elementary
school and middle school twice. She grew up in a very complicated family
environment. The reason her parents divorced was because her mother had
a sexual relationship with her uncle.</p>
<p>However, the reasons that prompted her to commit suicide were more
complicated. She also had sexual relations with her grandfather and
father. She had always been troubled by this, and she was still in her
first year of middle school at the time, and she began to miss school
for a long time two months before the summer vacation. Finally, one day
just after noon, she went to the backyard of her uncle’s house, which
was the cause of her parents’ divorce, poured gasoline all over her
body, and committed suicide by setting herself on fire.</p>
<p>She often played volleyball in school and gave the impression of an
ordinary student.</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-11">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>A shocking example of a twelve-year-old girl setting herself on fire,
but the first thing to note is the place of death. Her hatred for her
uncle may be quite large, so going to her uncle’s backyard to turn into
a fireball is also very effective in arousing her desire for revenge. It
is even more surprising that a twelve-year-old girl has sexual relations
with her grandfather and father. It is so terrible! She herself probably
felt that committing suicide to vent her fear, resentment, and despair
required a conspicuous method, not methods such as jumping off a
building or crashing into a car. In this case, self-immolation is most
appropriate. However, she was absent from school for two months before
the summer vacation. That means she only went to school in April and
May. So what happened when she transferred schools twice during this
period? From the source material, I still can’t figure it out, could
there be a more complicated hidden secret!?</p>

<p>If you can find a good location, it’s easy. However, be aware that it
is possible that after a large-scale search, you will be rescued, but
your hands and feet will be frozen and must be amputated.</p>
<p>Freezing to death is probably as comfortable as hanging yourself.
Hearing something like this, you may question its authenticity, but this
is what the survivors said, so you have to believe it.</p>
<p>Even so, the number of people who use freezing as a means of suicide
is definitely in the minority, and statistically they are also
classified in the “other” category. Perhaps it is because it is too
troublesome to go to the snowy mountains. But freezing to death is not a
phenomenon that only occurs in snowy mountains and cold areas. As long
as the conditions are right, people can freeze to death in rooms. Of
course, the temperature does not have to be below freezing. Reports show
that in fact, more than a dozen people freeze to death in Tokyo every
year, and there are also cases in warmer places. Newspapers often report
on homeless people freezing to death. For homeless people in Tokyo and
Osaka, surviving the cold winter is a very practical wish.</p>
<p>All of this is just a lot of useless theory. After all, no one wants
to freeze to death in a room, and I have never heard of someone
committing suicide by freezing to death in a room. In the United States,
some people commit suicide by freezing to death in a refrigerator. This
can only be regarded as an exception. If you want to freeze to death,
although it is troublesome, it is better to go to the snowy mountains.
This method has many advantages. How can it make up for the trouble!? It
will be introduced in detail below, such as no damage to the body and
less pain.</p>
<p>A person’s tolerance to cold is an important factor, so this method
of suicide is not suitable for people who are too tolerant of the
cold.</p>
<h2 id="preparation-4">Preparation</h2>
<h3 id="select-a-mountain-leisure-spot-as-your-target">Select a mountain
leisure spot as your target!</h3>
<p>If you want to go to the snowy mountains, first buy a guide book for
a cold mountain retreat to understand the situation. Even without
mountain climbing experience or physical strength, anyone can go to
places that are cold enough to freeze to death. When you go skiing, go
to places that are rarely visited. You might even be able to find a
suitable place next to the ski practice area. Of course, those who enjoy
mountaineering can decide the route and location very thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Things you need to bring: sedatives, painkillers and other drugs that
can stabilize your mood and help you fall asleep, as well as alcohol
available at pharmacies. Although drinking alcohol can raise your body
temperature, drinking to overcome pain is also allowed. Anyway, it is
difficult to resist the cold outside in the snow. If you take off your
clothes, you can die in one night, but it is a bit difficult, so you
should find a place where others can’t find it for at least two or three
days. If you can fall asleep, that would be even better.</p>
<h3
id="if-you-choose-to-freeze-to-death-in-the-room-you-have-to-choose-the-coldest-time-of-winter">If
you choose to freeze to death in the room, you have to choose the
coldest time of winter</h3>
<p>If you really want to die in your room, you have to choose a day in
the middle of winter. You also have to look at the weather forecast and
choose the coldest night. In addition, you must make some preparations
to cool down your body: pour water on your whole body while being naked,
then face the electric fan and air conditioner, and open the windows and
refrigerator. It also requires fasting, lack of sleep and fatigue,
otherwise it will be difficult to achieve. If you drink some wine
beforehand, it will dilate the blood vessels on the surface of the body,
quickly lower the body temperature, and has the effect of hastening
death. Of course, some patience is also required, which is also the
patience to wait for sleep to come.</p>
<p>Ways to freeze to death on the streets: Wear wet clothes to secluded
parks, open spaces and woods at night. In order to avoid people’s
suspicion, you can also bring a water bottle and pour it on when you
decide on the spot. Try to choose a cement floor that dissipates heat
quickly, but the most important thing is to keep it out of sight.</p>
<p>When the temperature is 5 °C, with no wind, half-naked, and with an
empty stomach, people can freeze to death in a day. There are also
examples of drunken people, who, returning home, fell asleep on the side
of the road and froze to death at nights as cold as 5 °C.</p>
<p>In water, when the temperature is 15 °C, the risk of freezing to
death is already significant. If the water temperature is 5 °C, you will
die after being immersed for several hours. Moreover, such water
temperatures can sometimes cause cardiac arrest in an instant. A
43-year-old housewife, who sent letters announcing her suicide to the
editorial offices of newspapers and magazines, froze to death in the
middle of winter, while sitting in a roadside park pond in Muroran
City.</p>
<h2 id="experience-a-sweet-trance">Experience: “A sweet trance”</h2>
<p>Whether you crawl into a snowdrift or strip naked in your room, the
process of dying is the same.</p>
<p>At first, the whole body will shiver. When the rectal temperature
reaches 35 °C, fatigue, lethargy and drowsiness will occur. The famous
slang phrase “You’ll die if you sleep on it!” even children say refers
to this situation. When the body temperature drops to 34 or 33 °C, the
ability to think gradually weakens, the consciousness is blurred, and it
will be enveloped by a “sweet trance”. When the temperature reaches 30
to 23 °C, they lose consciousness until death. When it drops below 25
°C, death is certain, so it’s a much more refreshing death than one
might have imagined.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/10_1.png"
alt="Figure 1: The relation between rectal body temperature and maximal blood pressure." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 1: The relation between rectal
body temperature and maximal blood pressure.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Regarding this sweet trance, someone who survived such a suicide
attempt said: “With shortness of breath, there is a kind of… delirium…”
In addition, a scholar’s report obtained from an interview contained the
following description: “Thousands of dazzling rays of light shone before
her eyes, and the roar of thousands of cannons rang in her ears. She
felt a sharp pain in her feet, as if she were running on a needle
mountain, and soon drowsiness came. The calm weariness of a person kept
emerging, and it seemed that she was liberated from the worries and
disasters of the world. The air was fresh, like a spring breeze, and
beautiful music sounded in her ears again. She leaned against the soft
fur pillow as if taking a nap, all kinds of colorful lights were shining
again, and she soon became unconscious. She only regained consciousness
after being rescued.”</p>
<p>Some survivor also said: “I had a dream of dancing wildly at a grand
banquet.”</p>
<p>Based on the above reports, it can be said that, like committing
suicide by jumping off a building, freezing to death is a completely
painless method of suicide except for the initial coldness.</p>
<h2 id="corpse-appearance-is-it-really-the-most-beautiful">Corpse
appearance: Is it really the “most beautiful”?</h2>
<p>Bodies that freeze to death in snowy mountains are the same as those
that commit suicide by gas. They are sometimes described as “the most
beautiful way to die”, but this varies depending on the time of
discovery. If the body is frozen and preserved due to snow, the skin
will appear translucent white, due to the total contraction of
capillaries near the body surface. However, when the spring snow melts,
the corpse will rot. The livor mortis are red, because oxygen combines
with hemoglobin in the blood to turn into pink oxidized hemoglobin.</p>
<p>In places such as snow-capped mountains, sometimes the tips of the
hands and toes may have edema due to frostbite. Occasionally, a person
may become insane and take off their clothes and be discovered as a
naked corpse. There are also many corpses torn apart by wild animals
(Case study 26). So in this way, it cannot be said to be very
beautiful.</p>
<h2 id="note-you-might-be-found">Note: You might be found</h2>
<p>No matter where you decide to die, the most important thing is to not
be found halfway. In snowy mountains, if your hands and feet are
partially frozen and rescued, they may need to be amputated. However,
necrosis will not occur unless the temperature drops below freezing.</p>
<p>In addition, in the case of suicide in the snowy mountains, huge
search costs will be incurred when family members and friends find out
and request a search. Therefore, you must do some tricks in advance. For
example, don’t leave a suicide note hinting your whereabouts. Make a
recorded voice mail text (“leave your message after the beep”) as if you
are leaving home on a standard trip.</p>
<p>If you really want to commit suicide, it is better to go to the snowy
mountains. To freeze to death in a room or on the roadside is quite
difficult, requiring all the right conditions to be in place, and it
must be difficult for you to be discovered.</p>

id="case-study-26-female-playwright-who-froze-to-death-in-snowy-mountains">Case
study 26: Female playwright who froze to death in snowy mountains</h2>
<p>In June 1981, the skeletal body of a woman was discovered at the 5th
station of Mount Kurodake in Daisetsuzan Mountains, Ishikari Mountains,
central Hokkaido. The location was in a primeval forest about 300 meters
above the mountain. This female writer was Keiko Sugie (杉江慧子) (47
years old at the time) who had participated in the production of
<em>Seven Detectives</em> <a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/10_2.png" alt="Figure 2: The map near Kurodake." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 2: The map near
Kurodake.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bones were scattered everywhere at the scene, and only the skull,
right thigh and calf bones were found. In winter, foxes, wild rats and
other wild animals appear frequently in this area, and there are traces
of being bitten by animals. They must have been enjoyed by these animals
in winter! Near the body was a bottle of sleeping pills with remaining
pills inside. It is estimated that the amount of sleeping pills taken
did not reach a fatal amount. There was also a large bottle of whiskey
in the bag, with about 80% left. The date of the ticket found among her
belongings was October 24, 1980, the year before last. It is believed
that she traveled from Tokyo, where she lived, to the sparsely populated
snowy mountains in winter, walked from the station into the primeval
forest, took sleeping pills, fell asleep, and froze to death.</p>
<p>Keiko Sugie started writing plays about five years ago. She was very
worried about not being able to get ahead, and at the same time she was
panicking about her growing age. Although there were several lines of
scrawled writing on the remaining manuscript, the ink was soaked in
water and could not be read. As a result, the motive for her suicide was
never clear.</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-12">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>This is a typical snow-capped mountain suicide after taking sleeping
pills and falling asleep in the snow. However, the remains were horrific
and not the most beautiful. If you commit suicide in the snowy
mountains, the body will turn into bones after ten months, and you must
also be careful about attacks by wild animals.</p>
<p>In addition, when committing suicide by freezing to death in the
snowy mountains, it is necessary to do some field research in advance.
Sugie wrote some of the script of “Saturday Night at the Mysteries” (TV
Asahi)<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> that has become a posthumous work,
which is set in Hokkaido, so she has a lot of knowledge about the local
area, so she had done her research.</p>
<p>If choosing a place to commit suicide is too troublesome, I would
advise you to take the same route as she did. To be cautious, let me
introduce the method to get to Kurodake. First go to Asahikawa, and then
take a two-hour ride from Asahikawa to Sounkyo Hot Spring. Then take the
cable car, turn to the snow track at the cable car transfer point, and
enter the virgin forest (see Figure 2).</p>
<p>If you want to imitate the way she died, you can buy some sleeping
pills and sedatives that are available on the market as described in <a
href="#chapter_1">Chapter 1</a>. It would also be a good idea to bring a
large bottle of wine. Even if the body parts would end up scattered, at
least you will be dead before that happens.</p>
<h1 id="chapter_11">11. Special cases</h1>
<p><img src="img/11_0.png" /></p>
<p>There are many ways to commit suicide besides those introduced above.
For example, suicide by gun, which is hard to obtain in Japan, is not
described in detail here.</p>
<p>Movies and TV often show scenes of pointing a gun between the
eyebrows or temples and pulling the trigger, which seems to be a typical
method of committing suicide with a gun. However, this method of pulling
the trigger is not recommended. Since the skull is much harder than one
may imagine, if the angle is wrong, the bullet may bounce away. Even if
it penetrates, the bullet will shatter, and the fragments will damage
the brain in the skull, and then turn around and escape from the eyes or
the other side, a failed attempt. If you want to use a gun, hold it in
your mouth and shoot through the medulla oblongata of the back of the
brain. This is the correct way.</p>
<p>In this chapter, let’s learn about these other methods of suicide
based on case studies.</p>

<p>In August 1985, the decomposed bodies of two women were found in a
room in Toei apartment complex (都営団地), Adachi Ward (足立区), Tokyo.
This is a pair of sisters aged 25 and 23. The cause of death was
starvation. The estimated time of death is from the end of 1984 to
around February 1985. Next to the body, there is an old envelope with
the words “I’ll show you that I die.” written by my sister.</p>
<p>The older sister struggled to pay the medical expenses of her mother
and younger sister as well as the debts left by her father. Her positive
and serious work attitude was well received by her workplace, but her
monthly salary of 110,000 yen was insufficient for repaying the debt, so
she had to borrow money. Soon the amount of the loan reached 3 million
yen, and debt collection calls were made to the workplace. Even so, she
still works diligently. The younger sister moved to this place with her
parents and younger sister in 1965. Her mother was sick and her father
was away from home for many years, so she had a monthly living allowance
of 110,000 yen. My younger sister, who was already a bit schizophrenic,
was often bullied after she entered middle school and often did not go
to school. My older sister took care of her mother’s illness while
encouraging her younger sister. She also entered a vocational high
school for commerce<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>. However, when he was a senior in
high school, his father came back with a large debt and died of cancer
the following year. At this time, my sister suffered from
hyperthyroidism again, and my sister’s living allowance was canceled due
to her employment.</p>
<p>Her mother finally died of illness in 1983. However, her relatives
did not allow her to take back the ashes. From about this time, the
older sister also became tired of life. She placed garbage bags randomly
on the balcony, received constant phone calls for debt collection, and
began to miss work in June 1984. She was finally fired in September.
Moreover, in September, the electricity and gas were cut off due to
failure to pay on time, and in January of the following year, the tap
water was also cut off. Debt collectors came to the house for days, so
the two of them had to pretend to go out instead of taking out the
trash. In October, they went to the neighbors to ask for food. Some days
later, the neighbors came to them, worried, but they replied: “Don’t
worry about us anymore!”. In fact, the idea of ​​committing suicide might
had then been firmly established at this time. There is a local welfare
office near the apartment complex, but they had never gone there to
talk.</p>
<p>Probably the elder sister died after the younger sister. In the
spring, due to the infestation of flies and the overwhelming stench,
they were discovered. At that time, the younger sister was wearing a
T-shirt and trousers and cuddled up against her elder sister. For some
reason, the elder sister was naked, with upper body covered with a
cardigan, and lower body uncovered.</p>
<p>The room was filled with garbage, bedding and clothes. There were
also some magazines such as <em>Pia</em><a href="#fn60"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a>,
<em>Seventeen</em><a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>, and novels by Akagawa Jirou<a
href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>. On the wall are large posters of
Yumiko Ōshima<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a> and the fantasy comic <em>The Star
of Cottonland</em><a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>.</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-13">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>This is a staggering misfortune. Starving to death is a method that
one would only choose after suffering all the hardships that life can
give. Because they were so exhausted that they no longer had the
strength to even commit suicide.</p>
<p>Although there are great differences between people, as long as you
don’t drink water, you will die in one to two weeks, and if you only
drink water, you will starve to death in thirty to forty days. Energy
storage is also a big factor. The sisters were a little obese and
probably took longer to die than the average person.</p>
<p>All four members of this family have their own misfortunes, but the
elder sister’s misfortune is the most tragic. Her mother’s illness, her
father’s debts, her younger sister’s bullying and illness, all the
misfortunes fell on her shoulders. No matter how hard she tried, she got
no reward. Rather, the harder she tried, the worse the situation
became.</p>
<p>Her life seemed to be at a crossroads of whether to commit suicide or
not. Of course, it was possible for her to live, but she refused help
and chose death. Faced with this kind of life, are there still people
who would say such stupid things as “good things will happen only if you
live”, “you can do anything if you can die”, “suicide is only for the
weak”? To her “I’ll show you that I die.”, such people would have
nothing to say in reply.</p>
<p>Some people say starvation is the best way to commit suicide.
“Compared with other suicide methods, starving to death requires a lot
of patience and perseverance. Even if you suddenly don’t want to die,
there will be no sequelae and you can recover quickly.” We don’t know if
this is the case, though we can guess that the person who said this must
have had some experience with this.</p>

<p>In November 1988, a man’s skeletal body was discovered in the Tottori
Sand Dunes<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>. At around one o’clock that
afternoon, a local old man who was walking in an almost deserted place
far away from the tourist routes found a skull slightly exposed in the
sand. After calling the police, he unearthed a small shovel in his left
hand, squatting as if holding it against his chest. Bodies in the
sandpit.</p>
<p>This man was a missing person in 1974, that is, fourteen years ago,
due to a lovelorn relationship and illness. He was thirty-two years old
at the time. One night he came to the sand dune, dug a hole about one
meter deep on the slope of the dune with a shovel, squatted in, piled
sand on himself with his hands, and then buried his head in the sand and
suffocated to death.</p>
<p>A suicide note his parents received after his disappearance read:
“Don’t bother searching. It would be for nothing.”</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-14">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>This is a thorough example of someone determined to erase himself
from society.</p>
<p>Tottori Sand Dunes is a secret place in Japan that is as famous as
the Aokigahara, but committing suicide by burying yourself alive in the
quicksand of suffocation is extremely painful. Undiscovered for fourteen
years, his goal can be said to have been achieved, but it is not a
recommended method. Because there are still many ways to commit suicide
without the body being discoverable.</p>

<p>At about seven o’clock in the evening in February 1989, a 67-year-old
housewife rushed towards the Aso Bear Ranch in the Zodiac Garden in Aso
Town, Kumamoto Prefecture<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a>, about an hour and a
half away from her home, and jumped into the bear cub pen.</p>
<p>The keeper who heard the loud “pop” sound rushed over and saw only
the bear shed 2.5 meters away from the fence. Sixty-eight bears were
huddled together, like a small black mountain. After using a fire
extinguisher to disperse the bear, a human body emerged from the white
powder. The body had been torn apart by the cubs, the internal organs
were completely missing, a large hole was opened from the stomach to the
intestines, and there were several bite marks on the hands, feet and
other parts of the body. Her clothes were torn into pieces, as if she
were naked.</p>
<p>She was a devout Buddhist, and she has previously spoke of things
like, “she will fall into the world of demons”, “people die but their
souls live forever”, etc. When she left home that afternoon, she said,
“They told me to go into that world.” She also left a suicide note for
her husband. Her neighbors also thought she was a weird person.</p>
<p>Some people said that this woman had said before, “I want to be eaten
by a tiger.”<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> She also had thought about the
tiger cage next to the bear shed, but because she could not get past the
iron fence, she jumped into the bear shed.</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-15">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>Committing suicide by being eaten by animals is an unexpected method.
However, the motivation is a bit religious, and the way of death is too
unrealistic, so it cannot be used as a reference for suicide methods.
Moreover, this method is very painful, the corpse is horrible, and the
reliability of death is not high, so I don’t want to advise people to
use it.</p>

<p>American pathologist Dr. Jack Kevorkian is famous for developing a
unique suicide device “Thanatron”. This device is a 30-centimeter-high
design that contains physiological saline solution, Pentothal, and
potassium chloride in three bottles that are hung upside down. Pentothal
is an anesthetic used during surgery, and potassium chloride is a
powerful drug used in poisoning and execution. Its structure is that
after the suicide volunteer presses the button, the timer starts, and
the saline water automatically changes to Pentothal. One minute later,
the potassium chloride begins to flow into the body.</p>
<p>The person who committed suicide using this device in June 1990 was
American housewife Janet Adkins (54 years old at the time). When she was
diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 1989 and planned to commit
suicide, she heard about Dr. Kevorkian’s suicide device and got in
touch. Dr. Kevorkian prepared a white German Volkswagen van and searched
for a campground suitable for suicide. In June 1990, she and the doctor
got into a car and drove to the park. She hid behind the car. The doctor
first inserted the needle into the vein and injected the salt solution.
When the doctor adjusted the flow, Janet pressed the button. The
injection solution changed to Pentothal, and she fell asleep twenty
seconds later, and then Pentothal was switched to potassium chloride.
After forty seconds, her face turned red, and after another thirty
seconds, it turned blue, and soon red spots appear. The
electrocardiogram had completely become a straight line after five
minutes and thirty seconds. In fact, her heart had stopped beating
before that.</p>
<p>Janet was an English teacher and a serious woman with a passion for
classical music, traits substantially affected by her Alzheimer’s
disease.</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-16">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>This is the “assisted suicide incident” that has sparked a debate on
the right of dying with dignity across the United States.</p>
<p>At present, if you want to die completely reliably and safely, you
have no other choice but to rely on Dr. Kevorkian’s help. He also used
this device to cause two women to commit suicide in October 1991, and
there was an endless stream of people who came to him for consultation.
He was able to use the device because the state of Michigan, where he
lives, does not criminalize assisted suicide. In Japan, the criminal law
clearly stipulates the crime of assisted suicide. That’s why Janet went
all the way from Oregon to Michigan.</p>
<p>There is no pain other than the poke of the needle, and you can die
in your sleep, whether others see it or not. If you don’t want to die in
your room and are willing to go to the United States, you may wish to
get in touch with the doctor. However, it is unclear whether he would be
willing to use this device on people who are not suffering from terminal
illnesses.</p>
<p>Japan also has a Japan Death with Dignity Association
(日本尊厳死協会), but it only recognizes the right to die for terminally
ill cancer patients who cannot be cured with current medical technology
and is unwilling to take wasteful life-prolonging measures. It is
opposed to euthanasia for the general public.</p>
<p>The contact address for the Japan Death with Dignity Association is
as follows: 2nd Floor, Watanabe Building, 2-29-1 Hongo, Kyoto-dori,
Tokyo, Postal Code: 113, Tel: 03-3818-6563.</p>

study 31: A man who committed suicide by gas poisoning in an attempt to
defraud life insurance money</h2>
<p>In October 1971, a 56-year-old man was found to have committed
suicide by gas poisoning in a room of an apartment.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, the man signed up for insurance from
three companies “Yasuda Life”, “Daiichi Life” and “Daihyaku Mutual Life”
from May to July, two years before his suicide. Family members can
receive 72.6 million yen.</p>
<p>Before his death, he told people, “I want to leave the insurance
money for my children when I die.”</p>
<p>This man had suffered from tuberculosis for four years. Later, he
became passionate about keirin cycling betting<a href="#fn68"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a>,
and his family was financially ruined. He caused great misfortune to his
family and he felt ashamed and distressed. He was living away from his
family when he committed suicide.</p>
<p>While working for a real estate company, he also took on side jobs as
a bowling alley night guard and a life insurance salesman. He even
borrowed money from relatives and friends to pay insurance premiums
totaling 5.5 million yen.</p>
<p>According to colleagues at the real estate company, he was usually an
honest kind of person, and seemed to not be a person who would do this
kind of thing.</p>
<h3 id="check-the-cause-of-death-17">Check: the cause of death</h3>
<p>If it is a suicide using gas poisoning, the person who wants to
commit suicide should also know something about life insurance; that’s
why I introduced this example. Life insurance benefits, even if the
cause of death is suicide, will not be paid until one year after
purchase. Moreover, the earlier the insurance money is collected, the
more advantageous it is, so it is better to die immediately after one
year after signing the contract. However, there is probably no one other
than this man who would plan a suicide using such considerations.</p>

</figure>
<p>According to statistics from the Ministry of Health and Welfare in
1991, there were 11,313 “hangings, strangulation, and suffocation”
(hanging, strangling, suffocation by plastic bags, etc.), ranking first
by a huge gap. The second was “falling from height” (2119 people), the
third was (poisoning by) “solid or liquid” (1360 people), the fourth was
“drowning” (1342 people), and the fifth was “gas or steam” (1251
people). Further down, there are 865 people who jumped into a volcano,
783 people who suffered “heat injuries (self-immolation)”, 616 people
who suffered “blade weapons and sharp objects” (i.e. cutting their
wrists, etc.), and the 56 people who were electrocuted were the
exceptional few.</p>
<p>Hanging had lost the top spot to poisoning from 1955 to 1960, but in
1980 it rose to the 10,000 mark, and its top spot was as solid as a
rock. Jumping from a building also broke the 2,000 mark in 1986 when the
popular singer Okada Yukiko jumped. The following year, it rose to
second place and has since then remained stable, never been less than
2,000 people.</p>
<p>The wave of suicides caused by taking sleeping pills peaked in 1960.
It once rose to the top of the list, but then declined, but for some
reason it rebounded to more than 2,000 people between 1985 and 1987.
However, Currently, there is a slight downward trend due to increasingly
strict drug control. In 1960, there were more than 2,000 cases, but now
the number has dropped to about 1,400. When gas poisoning became popular
due to the expansion of natural gas infrastructure into households
around 1975, there were records of 3,000 people using it. After urban
gas supply has been converted to natural gas that does not contain
carbon monoxide, only about 1,000 people per year die from gas suicide,
using vehicle emissions. The ranking order generally remains unchanged.
Please refer to Figure 2 for the changes in suicide methods between men
and women.</p>

<p>The most striking difference between men and women is that women
often commit suicide by throwing themselves into water or plastic bags.
The majority of suicides are men all over the world. No matter which
suicide method, the male:female ratio is basically 3:2 to 2:1. However,
why for suicide by drowning, there are more women than man since ancient
Japan? Regardless of whether the total number of suicides by drowning is
greater or less, men commit suicide only 2/3 of women.</p>
<p>There are only about 100 to 200 suicides by suffocating with plastic
bags every year, but most of them are done by women. The reason is
completely unclear. As mentioned in the text, men commit suicide by
electrocution in surprisingly many ways. There are only over a hundred
electrocution suicides every year, of which only a dozen are female
suicides each year, while men never account for less than 90% of the
total. This is also an unsolved mystery among experts. Of course, some
people say that the woman lacked knowledge about electricity, but the
reason is not clear.</p>
<h2
id="jumping-off-buildings-is-very-popular-with-teenage-females">Jumping
off buildings is very popular with teenage females</h2>
<p>No matter which age group, hanging is definitely the majority, but
the majority are women in their teens and twenties. Since 1986, jumping
from a building has exceeded hanging. Especially among teenagers, in
1990 there were 74 people who jumped from buildings and 31 people who
hanged themselves. In 1986, the number was 162 to 78, a ratio of over
2:1. In 1985, only 52 teenage girls committed suicide by jumping from
buildings. It goes without saying that this was due to the influence of
Yukiko Okada, who committed suicide by jumping off a building. Her
influence on the history of suicide in Japan is immeasurable.</p>
<p>In the past, as an example of exceeding the number of hangings, in
1960, when sleeping pills were at their peak, there were 1,311 people in
their teens and twenties who hanged themselves, while the number of
suicides caused by sleeping pills reached 3,889.</p>
<p>However, barring this exception, hanging always ranks first among all
age groups at any time. It is said that suicide by handgun ranks first
in the United States, of course because it is easy to obtain handguns.
However, hanging is commonly used in other countries, including the
United States, which shows that hanging is the most popular method of
suicide.</p>
<h2 id="time-of-suicide">Time of suicide</h2>
<h3 id="may-is-the-peak-time-for-suicides">May is the peak time for
suicides</h3>
<p>Let’s first look at the months. All over the world, suicides tend to
happen more in spring and autumn and less in summer and winter. At the
same time, some reports say that there is more spring than autumn and
less winter than summer, with the most in April, followed by May, and
the least in December and January. However, no matter which month, the
difference is not huge. According to Japanese statistics in recent
years, May has the highest number of suicides.</p>
<p>According to the data of 1991, the situation of monthly suicides is
shown in Figure 3. This year, there were most suicides in May and very
few in February.</p>

<h3 id="even-suicide-rests-on-the-seventh-day">Even Suicide rests on the
seventh day</h3>
<p>I compiled the data of more than 2,000 suicides handled by ambulance
departments over the past six years in Tokyo. The order of suicides
(completed and attempted) is Tuesday (15.3%), Monday (14.9%), Friday
(14.5%), Sunday (13%), Saturday (13.8%).</p>
<p>A survey in a certain ward in Tokyo found that Thursdays had the most
people, and Wednesdays and Sundays had the least. Counting only those
who have actually died, Wednesday has the least number of completed
suicides.</p>
<p>More than a hundred years ago, statistics compiled by the French
sociologist Émile Durkheim showed that there were more people on
Tuesdays and Thursdays and fewer people from Friday to Sunday. The fact
that there are fewer Sundays is the same, and there is not much
difference on other days.</p>
<h3 id="more-suicides-occur-at-night-than-during-the-day">More suicides
occur at night than during the day</h3>
<p>According to the statistics on of 8,000 bodies processed by the Tokyo
Metropolitan Medical Examiner’s Office in 3 years starting at 1955, most
cases are between 21 and 24 o’clock at night, and the least amount is in
the early morning. Suicides caused by sleeping pills, which were very
popular at the time, accounted for 36% of suicides between 21 and 24
o’clock, and 56% occurred between 21 and 3 o’clock.</p>
<p>In Kamakura, a survey of failed suicides show that most suicides
happen at night, with fewer in the early morning and during the day. In
a survey conducted in the Wards area of Tokyo Metropolis, they divided a
day into 4 sections of 6 hours each, and found that the most frequent
successful suicides happened between 12 and 18 o’clock (32.1%) and
between 0 and 6 o’clock (27.4%), while the few were between 18 and 24
(19.0%) and 6 to 12 o’clock (21.4%). However, among those who failed,
the time between 18 and 24 o’clock accounted for 31.0%, followed by
29.4% between 12 and 18 o’clock.</p>
<p>These findings are inconsistent and cannot be generalized, but it is
at least plausible that suicide occurs more at night than in the
morning.</p>
<p>However, the order of the survey conducted in Niigata Prefecture was
0 to 6 o’clock (29.4%), 12 to 18 o’clock (23.5%), 18 to 24 o’clock
(21.6%), and 6 to 12 o’clock (17.6%). There are fewer between 5 and 12
hours, but they are roughly the same. It is difficult to analyze the
results other than this. In areas where elderly people commit suicide
more often in rural areas, the time of suicide can be said to be
different from that in cities.</p>
<h2 id="ranking-on-suicide">Ranking on suicide</h2>
<h3 id="suicide-is-2.5-times-as-common-as-homicide">Suicide is 2.5-times
as common as homicide</h3>
<p>So, are the number of suicides increasing? According to Figure 4,
after the war, there were two peaks from 1955 to 1958 and from 1983 to
1986. In one year, there were The number of more than 20,000 deaths has
been decreasing since then, with a slight increase in 1992. However, the
increase in 1983 was thought to be due to loan sharks,<a href="#fn69"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>
and in 1986 it was due to the influence of Okada Yukiko. Overall, it
generally fluctuates based on 20,000 people. This is 1.5 to 2.0 times
that of traffic accidents and 2.5 times that of homicides.</p>
<h3 id="suicide-ranks-among-the-top-among-those-aged-20-to-30">Suicide
ranks among the top among those aged 20 to 30</h3>
<p>In terms of causes of death, suicide ranks seventh in the past ten
years, following cancer, heart disease, cerebral hemorrhage, pneumonia,
bronchitis, accidents, and aging. In the post-war period, many people
died from tuberculosis and gastroenteritis, so the order is still behind
them. However, looking at age groups, records in recent years show that
suicide ranks first or second behind accidents or cancer among those in
their 20s and 30s. Among those aged 15 to 19 and 40 to 44, they also
ranked third. Among the elderly, who have a high suicide rate, the
ranking of suicides declines with age. This is the reason why the
Statistics and Information Department of the Ministry of Health and
Welfare said, “It may not be correct to say that most suicides are
elderly based on numbers alone.”</p>
<p>Cancer, which ranks first, kills more than 10,000 people in their
40s. But as people in their 50s, 60s, and 70s, the number of deaths
increases to 20,000, 40,000, and 60,000. At the same time, the ranking
order of suicide is fifth, sixth, and seventh.</p>
<p>Specifically, looking at the figures in 1991, there were 962 suicides
among people aged 20 to 24. The mortality rate per 100,000 people in
this age group was 10.4%, ranking second. The number of people aged 70
to 74 was 1,188, with a mortality rate of 30.5%, ranking ninth. Indeed,
the suicide index is high in proportion to the population. However, if
someone asks who has died the most by suicide, this ranking is an
important answer. It can be said that the younger generation from ten to
thirty years old has the largest number of deaths by suicide.</p>

<h3 id="an-incomprehensible-country-of-suicides-hungary">An
incomprehensible country of suicides – Hungary</h3>
<p>Even according to Japan’s statistical method, the difference between
that of the Ministry of Health and Welfare and that of the National
Police Agency is more than 1,000 among 20,000 people. To usefully
compare the statistics collected by different countries would be even
more difficult, but it is interesting to look at anyway.</p>
<p>According to the suicide mortality rate (number of suicide deaths per
100,000 people) according to the latest data from the WHO (World Health
Organization), Hungary, known as a country with a large number of
suicides, ranks first, accounting for 39.9 (1990 survey). Men alone
account for a staggering 59.9. The following are Sri Lanka’s 33.2
(1986), Finland’s 28.5 (1989), Denmark’s 24.1 (1990), Austria’s 23.6
(1990), 21.8 of the former Soviet Union (1990) and 21.9 of Switzerland
(1990). On the contrary, Greece has very little, only 3.8 (in 1989),
which can be said to be terrifyingly small. The others are Israel’s 6.8
(1988), Argentina’s 7.4 (1987), the United Kingdom’s 8.1 (1990),
Portugal’s 8.8 (1990), Puerto Rico 8.9 (1989), the Netherlands 10.2
(1989), Hong Kong 10.5 (1989), etc. To sum up, the numbers are foggy,
and there is no need to analyze them closely.</p>
<p>Among major countries, Japan was 16.4 (1990), the United States was
12.4 (1988), France was 20.9 (1989), and China was 17.1 (1989). It is a
characteristic of China that there are more female suicides in China
(unlike in other countries). In Canada, it was 13.3 (in 1989). Japan,
which jumped to first place during the second peak of sleeping pill
suicides and was known as the “suicide country”, is currently in the
middle of the ranking.</p>
<h3 id="guns-for-america-noose-for-germany">Guns for America, noose for
Germany</h3>
<p>It is also interesting that the means of suicide vary from country to
country.</p>
<p>According to the current statistics, the United States uses shooting,
Italy, which has the water capital Venice, uses water, and Germany uses
hanging. According to recent data, 47.1% of suicides in the United
States are caused by guns and explosives, which is indeed a lot. The
next highest is taking poison. Gas is 20.8%. Hanging is 20.5%. Other
methods are quite rare. For Italy, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia,
it’s said that most suicides are by gun.</p>
<p>According to data from West Germany in 1969, hanging accounted for an
absolute majority of 39% of all cases. The following is taking poison.
Sleeping pills are 23%, gas is 13%, and drowning is 9%. Of course, there
are also regional differences. Berlin has the most gas and Hamburg has
the most sleeping pills. The similarity with Japan is that only 5% of
people jump from buildings. Also in Sweden and Denmark, hanging is the
most common.</p>
<p>Data from England and Wales in the United Kingdom in 1965 showed that
among men, 34% were gas, followed by drugs 25%, hanging 13%. For women,
drugs account for 49% and gas accounts for 33%. Somehow these two are
surprisingly numerous, while other methods are all in single digits.</p>
<p>Drugs for France. According to data from 1966 and 1970, the first
place is drugs, the second place is sharp knives, and the third place is
gas. Women use drugs more often.</p>
<p>Drugs for India too. According to statistics in 1966, although only
912 suicides were recorded, the proportion was 46% with drugs, 22% with
drowning, and 14% with hanging.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, Africa, according to data published in 1962 and others,
in descending order: hanging (up to 50%), guns, poisons, and sharp
knives.</p>
<p>The above situation seems to reflect various national conditions.</p>
<h3 id="golden-gate-bridge-a-death-inducing-stunning-scenery">Golden
Gate Bridge, a death-inducing stunning scenery</h3>
<p>As in Japan, there are of course tourist attractions for suicides
outside of Japan.</p>
<p>The most famous one is the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, USA.
Many people who commit suicide there say that they did not come here for
the purpose of committing suicide, but witnessing the stunning scenery,
they were struck with suicidal thoughts just by the atmosphere. A
70-year-old man left a suicide note saying “How is it that this scenery
was created, that makes it so easy to suicide in?” and jumped off.
Similarly, Niagara Falls in the United States is also known as a suicide
tourist attraction. The Thames River in the United Kingdom and the
Ganges River in India have all been called suicide attractions. In
Japan, a counterpart could be the Kegon Falls (華厳滝) (See <a
href="#chapter_3">Chapter 3</a>).</p>
<h1 id="chapter_13">Postscript</h1>
<p>In the preface, I wrote an exaggerated opening manifesto about
“modern society and suicide”. I admit it is a bit exaggerated.</p>
<p>The original reason for writing this book was just because I was
tired of the idea that “you shouldn’t ever commit suicide”, which I
couldn’t think of any basis for, yet it was so naively accepted by the
public.</p>
<p>It can be seen everywhere that primary school teachers use “The
Importance of Life” as a topic to ask students to write essays; people
who commit suicide are casually said to have weak willpower, etc. A
society where people can easily say “you must live on with strength” is
not only so claustrophobic that it makes people unable to breathe, but
also makes life miserable. Therefore, let this book circulate, creating
the choice of “you can also seek death as a last resort”, and hope to
open a vent in the closed and terminal iron house of society, to let
fresh air in and make life easier. This is my true goal.</p>
<p>I’m not proposing some boring idea as “Let’s all commit suicide!”. If
you want to live, you must live with ease, and if you want to die, you
must die with ease. That’s how life should be, to live and die as you
wish. (<a href="#chapter_3">Chapter 3</a>, Case study 9)</p>

<h2 id="some-translation-notes">Some translation notes</h2>
<p>The translation is based on the Taiwanese edition, but occasionally I
had to refer to the Japanese edition to fix mistakes. There are plenty
of mistakes in the Taiwanese edition, but I think I have caught most of
them.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of footnotes. The first kind are formatted like
this <code>&lt;sup&gt;...&lt;/sup&gt;</code>, and those are produced by
Rena. The second kind are formatted like this <code>[^...]</code>, and
those are produced by me. A lot of the footnotes by Rena are pretty
useless and I deleted them.</p>
<p>Most of the long footnotes are excerpted from Wikipedia. I’m not
bothering with precise citations. If you really want to track them down,
you can Google them.</p>
<p>The document is <em>mostly</em> compliant to the extended Markdown
syntax. Why <em>mostly</em> compliant? Well, it’s because Markdown is
not a fully standardized format, and different parsers may interpret the
same document differently.</p>
<h2 id="citations">Citations</h2>
<p>There are three kinds of citations in the book.</p>
<p>The citations for the dosage of substances appearing in <a
href="#chapter_1">Chapter 1</a> are keyed with English letters from
<code>A</code> to <code>M</code>.</p>

<h2 id="publication-history">Publication history</h2>
<p>When the book was published in 1993, it was an immediate hit across
Japan, eventually selling over one million copies. In 1997, it was
finally designated as “harmful to the youth”, and thus could not be sold
to people under 18. However, it remains legal to sell to adults and is
still available in Japan.</p>
<p>Riding on the waves of the popularity, Tsurumi anthologized another
book that was published in 1994. 『ぼくたちの「完全自殺マニュアル」』
(<em>Our ‘Complete Suicide Manual’</em>). It contains two parts, the
first part describes how the Japanese society viewed <em>The Complete
Suicide Manual</em>. The second half contains reader letters sent to the
author about the book. As far as I can see, the book is like last year’s
hamburgers – tasty at the time, but it’s not going to last. In any case,
the book is not available on the Internet.</p>
<p>Both books were quickly translated and published in Taiwan in 1994,
and then banned in 1995. The book was also banned in Hong Kong. As for
China, though there is no explicit ban, it would have never made across
the publisher’s office anyway.</p>

<p>On 1993-10-20, the <em>Yomiuri Shimbun</em> reported that the bodies
of two suiciders were found in Aokigahara, with the book in their arms.
The police found a third person who appeared to be planning to suicide
was nearby, also holding this book. The police took them away from the
scene. The whole country was in an uproar, pushing the book’s sales to
the top of the rankings.</p>
<p>There has never been a printed Chinese edition, though the Taiwanese
edition has been circulating online for a while. In 2018, YuriMiller
(GitHub username) or Rena (self-identified name in the document)
uploaded a Chinese edition to GitHub. As described by Rena,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have completed part of the translation, proofreading, and
annotation myself, and I will say goodbye to this world soon. This book
is my final gift.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has never been a printed English edition either, though
continuing the tradition, I made the translation myself.</p>

<p>From reading the Japanese Wikipedia on the author, we can recognize
him to be a leftist. This makes it easy to understand why many case
studies have a leftist feeling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Born 1964. Japanese freelance writer. He graduated from the
Department of Sociology of the University of Tokyo.</p>
<p>The 2012 <em>Declaration of Post-Capitalism</em> focused on the
economic system as a reason why people cannot live comfortably. He
criticizes economic growth, overconsumption, and globalization, and
tries to regain interest in life by taking care of food, clothing, and
shelter himself. Furthermore, he emphasizes the connection with the
natural world and its systems as an alternative model to economic
systems.</p>
<p>In 2017, he published <em>Living with 0 Yen</em>. He introduced a
number of concrete methods of giving, sharing, and mutual aid that can
be done without using money, based on his own practice. The goal is to
reduce dependence on money and create a society in which people who
don’t have money or are not good at earning money can live in a more
comfortable society. Although the manual is exactly as its subtitle
suggests <em>How to create a small but prosperous economy</em>, it also
includes many explanations about gifts and the history of the monetary
economy.</p>
<p>In 2022’s <em>Half of Human Relationships</em>, he argues that human
relationships are ultimately the primary source of difficulty in living.
He confronts his past friendships, family relationships, and romantic
relationships, and insists on creating more variable relationships. To
that end, he also advocated the creation of a third place to live, and
wrote about the place he was creating himself. He points out that
Japan’s too close human relationships are also a problem, and believes
that behind this problem lies the negative effects of the glorification
of human relationships introduced after the Meiji period.</p>
<p>We operate a place for people with no connections, a place for the
maladjusted. Together with his friends, he also hosts an event called 0
yen shop, where unwanted items are released on the street for free. They
are also participating in a communal farm cultivated by surrounding
residents on abandoned state-owned land.</p>

<p>The publisher urgently recalled the “Complete X” series of books.
Chen Mingda, the person in charge of the “Complete X” series, returned
to Taiwan from the mainland in advance to deal with the aftermath.</p>
<p>New books scheduled to be published recently have also been
cancelled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Zhang Qiqun reporting in Taipei] The publisher of <em>The Complete
Revenge Manual</em>, which was found by the Taipei District Prosecutor’s
Office to be suspected of inciting others to commit crimes, and the
distributor, Li Ming Books, have launched recall measures on the 8th.
Another book that has also caused controversy, <em>The Complete Suicide
Manual</em> has also been recalled. Chen Mingda, the head of Jasmine
Publishing House, took a flight back to Taiwan last night to handle
related matters.</p>
<p>It is understood that this recall is a resolution reached by Jasmine
Publishing House and Li Ming Book Company the day before yesterday. Chen
Mingda, the head of Jasmine Publishing House, obtained <em>The Complete
Revenge Manual</em> abroad and was found guilty by domestic prosecutors
of abetting crimes. The company was notified by phone to urgently recall
all <em>The Complete Revenge Manual</em> and the agent publisher, Li
Ming Book Company of Sanchong City, Taipei County, was appointed to
handle the recall.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Li Ming Book Company dispatched foreign agents to
carry recall notices to booksellers in the north, while booksellers in
the central and southern parts of the country sent notices by fax,
hoping to have all <em>The Complete Revenge Manual</em> available in the
province recalled as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It is understood that under general practice, booksellers will return
the books within one month of receiving the recall notice. If the books
are not returned within the time limit, the publisher will no longer
accept the return. Therefore, the key to recall still depends on the
cooperation of the booksellers.</p>
<p>Lin Junyan, manager of Li Ming Book Company, said that <em>The
Complete Revenge Manual</em>, which was launched in March this year,
only had one edition printed. The market response was initially
mediocre, but it became popular after the media exposure. Booksellers
from all over the country have asked for supplements. At present, most
of the books on the market are likely to have reached consumers, so the
number of recalls may be limited, but the company will still do its
best.</p>
<p>Chen Mingda, the person in charge of the company, who was originally
in mainland China for business negotiations, also ended his trip to
mainland China early last night and took a flight back to Taiwan to deal
with follow-up matters. He said that when he published this series of
books, he focused on Japan, Hong Kong and other places. Facing the same
problem, Taiwan is following behind Japan and Hong Kong and is bound to
encounter the same situation. Therefore, it publishes books out of
concern for society and has successively published <em>Suicide in
Mind</em>, <em>The Complete Suicide Manual</em>, <em>The Complete Death
from Illness Manual</em>, <em>The Complete Disappearance Manual</em> and
<em>The Complete Revenge Manual</em> have no bad intentions of inciting
others to commit crimes or commit suicide.</p>
<p>Chen Mingda said that due to the criticism caused by this series of
books from the public, he has decided to recall in addition to the
approximately 3,000 copies of the <em>The Complete Revenge Manual</em>
on the market, and the approximately 10,000 copies of the <em>The
Complete Suicide Manual</em> after returning to China. And recycled it.
As for the other two <em>The Complete Death from Illness Manual</em> and
<em>The Complete Disappearance Manual</em>, they are also considering a
recall. All losses will be absorbed by the company itself. In addition,
he also canceled <em>The Complete Poisoning Manual</em> that the company
was scheduled to publish in the near future. The publication of books
will be more carefully researched and evaluated.</p>

<p>Prosecutors of <em>The Complete Revenge Manual</em> list publisher as
defendant.</p>
<p>Similar “black books and periodicals” will be compared with it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Gao Nianyi reporting from Taipei] Taipei District Prosecutor’s
Office Chief Prosecutor Lu Renfa believes that the content of the
recently published <em>The Complete Revenge Manual</em> is suspected of
inciting others to commit crimes. Yesterday, he instructed the publisher
Jasmine Publishing House to be named as a defendant, and the chief
prosecutor Chen Shiti investigated. Prosecutor General Lu Renfa
particularly emphasized that similar “black books and periodicals” not
only have a negative impact on society, but also may violate the law.
Once discovered by the procuratorate, they will handle it accordingly
and proactively investigate.</p>
<p>Lu Renfa emphasized that the prosecutor’s initiative to investigate
“black books and periodicals” was based on the provisions of the
Criminal Procedure Law that “the prosecutor should immediately start an
investigation if he knows there is a criminal suspicion.” There are
relevant regulations that provide protection or restrictions, and they
are not unlimited. He hopes that the outside world will not mistakenly
think that he is carrying out “White Terror”<a href="#fn70"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Chief Prosecutor Chen Shiti completed a research report yesterday and
concluded that the content of <em>The Complete Revenge Manual</em>
proposes various revenge techniques for unspecified people who are
dissatisfied with government officials, news media, offices, campuses,
neighbors, companies and relatives. Although some of the suggestions are
pure pranks, there are also patterns of bloody violence. The research
report believes that publishers are at risk of committing disorderly
conduct and inciting others to commit crimes.</p>
<p>After Chen Shiti sent a report to Prosecutor General Lu Renfa, Lu
Renfa believed that a detailed investigation was necessary and
immediately instructed Chief Prosecutor Chen Shiti to sign an
“otherwise” case (他字案)<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> and name Jasmine
Publishing House, the publisher of “The Complete Revenge Manual”, as a
defendant. If the investigation reveals that the publisher is suspected
of inciting others to commit crimes, an “investigation” case (侦字案)<a
href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a> will be signed to hold the
publisher accountable.</p>
<p>[Taipei News] Chen Mingda, the head of Jasmine Publishing House, said
last night that in addition to <em>The Complete Revenge Manual</em> that
he has decided to recall, he has also decided to withdraw <em>The
Complete Suicide Manual</em> from the market.</p>

isolated are especially vulnerable to the appeals of extremist
movements. It reached its peak in late 1950s. Its main goal was to
explain totalitarian regimes in the 20th century, especially the rise of
fascism and communism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>William Kornhauser – trained in Chicago School sociology – wrote The
Politics of Mass Society (1959). It remains one of the most explicit
statements of the alleged links between mass society and social
movements. Written in the shadow of aforementioned totalitarian
tendencies, mass society theory sought to explain the rise of extremism
abroad and the dangers to democracy at home. Recalling Durkheim’s
analysis of egoism and anomie, mass society emerges when small local
groups and networks decline, leaving powerful elites and massive
bureaucracies on one side and isolated individuals on the other. As
Kornhauser wrote: “Mass society is objectively the atomized society, and
subjectively the alienated population. Therefore, mass society is a
system in which there is high availability of a population for
mobilization by elites … People who are atomized readily become
mobilized” (Kornhauser 1959: 33). Put slightly differently, mass society
is one where “both elites and non-elites lack social insulation; that
is, when elites are accessible to direct intervention by non-elites, and
when non-elites are available for direct mobilization by elites”
(Kornhauser 1959: 43).</p>

<p>In short, the United Red Army was a merger of two groups, the

Revolutionary Left Faction led by Hiroko Nagata.</p>
<p>The Red Army Faction was an organization led by Japanese college

of Japan. This split came as a result of a tense disagreement regarding

would move the process of revolution forward”.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Left group split off from the Japanese Communist

obtaining weaponry, such as with their gun shop robbery of 1971.</p>

wife of the lodge-keeper as a hostage. A standoff between Japanese
police and the URA radicals took place, lasting ten days. The lodge was
a natural fortress, solidly constructed of thick concrete on a steep
hillside with only one entrance, which, along with their guns, enabled
the hostage-takers to keep police at a distance. On February 28, the

<p>The corpses were found on 1986-10-31 on a beach in Wakayama
prefecture. Nearby was a plastic container of kerosene, which police
surmised the woman used to immolate themselves.</p>
<p>The church was headquartered about 500 meters away from where their
bodies were found. They ranged in age from 25 to 67, included the wife
of the cult leader, and by some accounts were each related by blood to
her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The seven women were Nobuyo Miyamoto, aged 42; Tomoyo Ka- waguchi,
67; Yumiko Yamamoto, 35; Yasuko Matsuo, 28; Kimiyo Ochiai, 37; Midori
Tsuji, 35; and Noriko Miyamoto, 25. Nobuyo Miyamoto was the wife of
Seiji Miyamoto, 62, who had been the leader of a local religious cult,
Mzchz-no-torno Kyokaz (the Friend of the Truth Church).</p>
<p>Believers demonstrated re- spect for the leader by addressing him as
“the Spirit of the Truth or”the Teacher”. His teaching consisted of
fortune-telling, consulting about miscellaneous problems of daily
living, and preaching “the true way of life”. The Friend of the Truth
Church is a local cult that combines elements of Christianity and
Buddhism. The members of the church believe in Jehovah, the Almighty;
however, there is a statue of Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of mercy, in
the church. Its simplistic and mundane belief is that, if one leads an
honest life and cleanses the spirit, one can ask for relief in heaven
after one’s death. The believers did not even read the Bible. They never
solicited donations or expanded their doctrine aggressively. They
accepted those who came voluntarily, but never tried to persuade
neighbors to join them.</p>
<p>Thirteen suicide notes were found in Miyamoto’s house addressed to
the women’s families. Several of the suicide notes had been written
about 3 years previously; these read, “If our Teacher dies, I wish to
accompany him to heaven. I wish from the bottom of my heart that those
who live after our Teacher’s death will keep his teachings and let the
world know them.” It is reported that there was no order or coercion
from either the leader or some church members for the women to kill
themselves after the leader’s death, and that the mass suicide took
place of the women’s own free will. Other members of the church remained
eerily calm and serene, and accepted the mass suicide as a natural
consequence. One of them said, “The Teacher died. They must have

<li id="fn69"><p>Sarakin (サラ金) is a Japanese term for a legal
moneylender who makes unsecured loans at high interest. It is a
contraction of the Japanese words for salaryman (サラリーマン,
Sararīman) and loan (金融, kin’yu).</p>
<p>Strict and often bullying loan collection techniques practiced by
sarakin, combined with the importance in Japanese culture of “saving
face”, have driven many small-business men to despair and suicide. Many
sarakin used to be affiliated with organized crime groups (yakuza) and a
scandal blew up in the early 1980s because of their unsavory, if
effective, collection methods, such as showing up at a funeral or
wedding to demand money, or using a loudspeaker in front of homes,
schools or workplaces to broadcast non-payment of debt. These actions
led to the term sarakin-jigoku (サラ金地獄), or “loan shark hell”, being
coined by the media and legislation which set the code of conduct for
money collection.<a href="#fnref69" class="footnote-back"
