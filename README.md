# CompleteSuicideManual-En

English translation of "The Complete Suicide Manual", with annotations.

The translation is based on the Taiwanese edition, but occasionally I had to refer to the Japanese edition to fix mistakes. There are plenty of mistakes in the Taiwanese edition, but I think I have caught most of them.

Start reading at the [contents page](English/contents.md).

Alternatively, download the folder and open the `English/_build/html/index.html` in your browser.

The Chinese version is in [Chinese](Chinese) folder.

The Japanese version is available by searching for "完全自殺マニュアル" in various ebook piracy websites, such as Library Genesis, Anna's Archive, etc.
